<P>
The federal government is looking to train 2,000 more people to do energy audits as it tries to get a new green home renovation program off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan says the government will provide up to $10 million in contracts to recruit, train and mentor 2,000 energy advisers to advise people how to cut their home energy use.
</P>
<P>
The government is issuing a call for proposals Monday to anyone wanting to take on the job of training and recruiting the new workers.
</P>
<P>
They will then help provide the energy audits and advice needed for the Canada Greener Homes Grant to work.
</P>
<P>
The program unveiled last fall, but not yet launched, is to provide up to $5,000 grants to homeowners to make upgrades that curb their energy use, but requires a registered energy adviser to do a pre-renovation assessment and then a post-renovation evaluation.
</P>
<P>
It's just a fraction of the $40,000 interest-free loans for home energy retrofits Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the 2019 federal election.
</P>
<P>
The recent federal budget promised $4.4 billion over the next five years to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which will administer those $40,000 loans.
</P>
<P>
O'Regan would offer no details Monday on how the loans and grants will be different, saying Canadians should stay tuned because he didn't want to "scoop" himself.
</P>
<P>
But he said the 2,000 new energy advisers will be needed for the loan program, which should be ready this summer. The $5,000 grants will be ready to launch first.
</P>
<P>
"We need to train more because I think very soon we will be announcing an ambitious greener homes initiative and it is going to affect thousands of Canadians," O'Regan said.
</P>
<P>
"And we know that energy advisers are going to be in demand. Recruiting up to 2,000 more of them right across the country is a very good investment for what's coming down the pipe on the greener homes announcements."
</P>
<P>
All buildings in Canada, including homes, private businesses and public buildings, contribute almost one-fifth of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely from the fuels used for heating and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Energy retrofits could include installing better windows, improving insulation, upgrading to a more efficient furnace or adding solar panels.

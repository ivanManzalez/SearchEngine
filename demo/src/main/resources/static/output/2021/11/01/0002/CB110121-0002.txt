Nearly 600 people died due to extreme temperatures in British Columbia over the summer, according to new data from the provincial coroners' service.
</P>
<P>
New figures released Monday said the deaths of 595 people between June 18 and Aug. 12 were related to the heat. The majority of those deaths — 526 — happened during the "heat dome" that created temperatures above 40 C from late June to early July.
</P>
<P>
The service said 231 people died in a single day on June 29 — nearly 10 people every hour.
</P>
<P>
The staggering tally comes as health-care advocates, first responders and politicians try to determine what kind of action — or inaction — might have contributed to the number of people who died as a result of the incessant heat.
</P>
<P>
"The impacts, as we see by today's report, were tragic, and the loss of life devastating," Health Minister Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday. "It's vital that we learn from these events."
</P>
<P>
99% died at home or hotel 
</P>
<P>
The data released Monday presents a clearer picture of the people who died and where they lived in B.C.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 per cent of those who died were over the age of 70. More than half lived in the Fraser Health Authority area, while roughly a quarter lived in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver, Surrey and Burnaby saw the highest numbers of deaths by town, with 99, 67 and 63, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Prince George, a city further north in B.C., said the news that 12 people died in his own community was a "complete shock." The city saw a higher numbers deaths per capita than more populated cities like Richmond or Nanaimo.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the underlying factor is, were these folks homeless? For people who are living on the street, it's the weather that impacts them the greatest. I would like to see the breakdown," said Lyn Hall.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine per cent of people died after overheating inside a home or hotel. The remainder died after being in the heat outside or in a public building, such as a business or community centre.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of men to women was similar, though slightly more women died. No children died.
</P>
<P>
'No longer a one-in-1,000-year event'
</P>
<P>
Early analysis by climate groups in July found the heat wave would have been "virtually impossible" without climate change.
</P>
<P>
Some groups said extreme events are intensifying and becoming more common as greenhouse emissions continue, making more extreme heat waves a likely part of B.C.'s future.
</P>
<P>
"It has now happened," Dix said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a one-in-1,000-year event — it's a one-in-one-year event, and we need to respond and become more resilient, not just as a health-system, but as a province."
</P>
<P>
In total, more than 800 sudden deaths were reported to the coroner between June 25 and July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's data confirms 526 of those deaths were a direct result of extreme temperatures during the heat dome. A report from Human Rights Watch last month found lack of government support left the elderly population and people living with disabilities at risk during the heat — and that a lack of a provincial heat response plan contributed to "unnecessary suffering and possibly deaths."
</P>
<P>
Report on every death expected in 2022
</P>
<P>
The coroner uses two criteria to classify a death as heat related, the statement explained: either the person's environment or body temperature is consistent with hyperthermia, or there is evidence to support that heat would have been a significant factor in their death, such as medical history.
</P>
<P>
Chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said by identifying patterns and factors in each of the deaths, the province will be "in a better position to prevent future similar tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
She said everyone in B.C. must begin to prepare for future extreme weather events.
</P>
<P>
"Having a plan to regularly check in with loved ones who live alone, being aware of cooler and air-conditioned areas in your neighbourhood, and heeding early warnings about extreme weather are simple steps that will help ensure we are all properly prepared and safe,'' Lapointe wrote.
</P>
<P>
The statement said all of the deaths are being investigated and reports on each fatality should be finished by early 2022.

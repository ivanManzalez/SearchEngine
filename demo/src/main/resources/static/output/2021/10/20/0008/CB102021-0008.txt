Halifax regional council has approved a $29-million tender to Dartmouth-based Brycon Construction to develop lots for light industrial companies in the Burnside industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The new phase, to be spread out over 48.5 hectares, will include four new streets and a roundabout. 
</P>
<P>
"The current industrial market is not unlike the current housing market, where supply and resources have not kept pace with demand," a new staff report says. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Halifax Regional Municipality expect the lots to be sold within two to three years, and more expansion phases are in the planning stages.

'Frustration' about transit
</P>
<P>
Some councillors expressed worry about how more workers will travel to the industrial park and get around inside it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a frustration when it comes to transit in Burnside," said Coun. Tony Mancini. "Transit needs to improve dramatically."
</P>
<P>
The head of Halifax Transit told council there's time to come up with a new network of bus routes before the new lots are sold and developed.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we'll be able to take the information of this new area and pull that into the service plan," said Dave Reage.
</P>
<P>
The new phase will also include sidewalks and two kilometres of trails for cyclists.

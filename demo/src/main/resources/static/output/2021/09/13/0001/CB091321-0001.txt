<P>
Calgary city council, sitting for the last time before the Oct. 18 election, voted 12-1 to help fund the stalled Barron Building conversion project on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, transforming an iconic 1950s office tower into residential units, has been stalled for over two years.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the historic 11-storey complex, Calgary-based Strategic Group, halted work on the project a couple of years ago when it found the cost of completing the job would be higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
The property development company has also run into financial troubles as a result of economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Council will provide $7.5 million to help complete the conversion, but that money won't flow until the project is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The money is not part of a larger pot on offer for conversions in the core, one aspect of a larger plan to cut soaring vacancy rates downtown that could cost $1 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Barron Building isn't eligible for that cash because the project started before the program was put in place this year.

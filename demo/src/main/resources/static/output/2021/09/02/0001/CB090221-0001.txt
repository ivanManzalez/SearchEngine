Applications for Saskatoon's Home Energy Loan Program (HELP) opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program is to help homeowners install renewable energy options and improve efficiency. The city is offering low interest loans from $1,000 to $60,000 to cover upfront costs of retrofits.
</P>
<P>
"Some examples of retrofits an owner might consider with this financing include replacing a low efficiency furnace with a higher efficiency model," said the city's director of sustainability Jeanna South at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
According to South, HELP is not intended for smaller changes, like switching to LED lights or buying energy efficient appliances. 
</P>
<P>
HELP loans are repaid through property taxes over five-, 10-, or 20-year terms, and remain attached to the property. If someone moves before the loan is repaid, the new homeowner will take on loan repayment.
</P>
<P>
The city looked at similar programs in other cities, including Halifax's Solar City program. South said Halifax's program has been such a success that the city is looking at expanding it. 
</P>
<P>
South also said that just a few hours after applications opened, the city had already received several. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been receiving a number of calls from both homeowners and from folks in the construction industry who are pretty excited about the program as well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is anticipated to run for two years, according to South. The city has $2.5-million in funding that is expected to cover loans for approximately 100 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Should the program be a success, the city may look into crafting another one, said South,.

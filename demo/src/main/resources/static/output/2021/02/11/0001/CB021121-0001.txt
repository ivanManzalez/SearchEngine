CBC British Columbia launched Go Public in October 2007.
</P>
<P>
You can see and hear the segment regularly on CBC News: British Columbia, CBC News: Calgary, The National, CBC News Network, CBC Radio and CBC.ca.
</P>
<P>
We get to the bottom of the problem and go after who should be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
But we don't make the news – you do.
</P>
<P>
All of our story ideas come from people who contact us. Many of those people also appear prominently in the stories themselves.
</P>
<P>
If your story is one we can tackle and it's in the public interest, we will take it on. 
</P>

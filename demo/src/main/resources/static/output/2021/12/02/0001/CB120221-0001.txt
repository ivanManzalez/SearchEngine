City of Calgary may extend amnesty for illegal secondary suite owners; 
</P>
<P>
Officials say program has resulted in more safe suites being added to city registry
</P>

<P>
A Calgary city council committee has thrown its support behind a proposal to extend the city's secondary suite amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, council approved the amnesty as a way of encouraging property owners with illegal secondary suites to bring them into compliance.
</P>
<P>
Under the amnesty, the city waives development permit and suite registry fees while ensuring existing suites comply with minimum safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty runs until the end of December 2021.
</P>
<P>
The city was hoping that would result in 5,000 safe and legal suites being posted on its registry of inspected secondary suites.
</P>
<P>
That registry has now topped 6,500 suites.
</P>
<P>
Administration is proposing that council approve extending the amnesty by another two years in hopes of reaching 13,000 safe suites.
</P>
<P>
Council's infrastructure and planning committee gave its support on Wednesday to the extension.
</P>
<P>
The committee's chair, Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra, said continuing with the amnesty period will encourage more owners of illegal suites to upgrade their properties, get them inspected and then be added to the city's registry.
</P>
<P>
"The amnesty program really [incentivizes] landlords and tenants and the city to work together to bring the suite in question up to code so it's safe for people who live there," said Carra.
</P>
<P>
"We've got thousands and thousands of Calgary households that are living in these suites."
</P>
<P>
In 2013, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation estimated there were at least 16,000 illegal suites in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
A coordinator of issues management with the city, Cliff de Jong, told the committee that even with the amnesty in place, complaints about safety violations are still acted upon.
</P>
<P>
He said the city will work with the property owner to ensure compliance but also provide education on how to legalize their suite.
</P>
<P>
If they refuse, de Jong said the courts have handed out hefty fines for safety violations.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that extending the amnesty could provide an avenue for property owners to avoid court appearances by upgrading their suites.
</P>
<P>
"It actually helps people come forward because that's what we're asking people to do. Trust us. Come forward. We'll work with you," said de Jong.
</P>
<P>
The committee gave its support to the proposal which will be discussed by city council as a whole later this month.

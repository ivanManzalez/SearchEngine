Kansas City beats San Francisco in OT to become 1st repeat Super Bowl champs in 19 years; 
</P>
<P>
Mahomes wins 3rd Super Bowl MVP after throwing game-winning TD to Hardman
</P>

<P>
Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Kansas CityÂ are back-to-back Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
Mahomes threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and Kansas CityÂ rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the first repeat Super Bowl champs in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
With pop star Taylor Swift watching boyfriend Kelce from a suite, Kansas CityÂ captured itsÂ third title in five years and firmly established themselves as a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know the goal has always been to get three," Kelce screamed on stage after sharing a kiss with Swift. "But we couldn't get here without getting that two, and having that target on our back all year. ... How about that. We get a chance to do it three times in a row."
</P>
<P>
The NFL's first Super Bowl in Las Vegas was a sloppy, mistake-filled affair that was mostly boring until the back-and-forth fourth quarter and overtime drama. It was the second of 58 Super Bowls to be tied after regulation, and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City trailed 22-19 after Jake Moody kicked a 27-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime, but Mahomes rallied his team, completing another impressive comeback in a rematch of the Super Bowl four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mahomes ran eight yards on fourth-and-oneÂ to keepÂ Kansas City'sÂ chances alive and then scrambled 19 yards to set up the winning score, which came 14:57 into the extra period â€” just before what would have been the second OT.
</P>
<P>
"With all the adversity we've been through this season to come through tonight. ...Â I'm proud of the guys," said Mahomes, who was named MVP. "This is awesome. Legendary."
</P>
<P>
After he connected with a wide-open Hardman, K.C.Â ran on the field as red-and-yellow confetti fell onto the turf.
</P>
<P>
The anatomy of the game-winner. What a Super Bowl. ðŸ”¥ <a href="https://t.co/WbGaPP39yV">pic.twitter.com/WbGaPP39yV</a>
</P>
<P>
The most excitement in the first half came when a frustrated Kelce bumped Andy Reid on the sideline, knocking the 65-year-old Kansas City coach a few steps back after teammate Isiah Pacheco fumbled inside the red zone during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"You guys saw that?" Kelce said. "I'm going to keep it between us unless my `mic'd up' tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him."
</P>
<P>
The action picked up after a crucial blunder by San Francisco's special teams set up Mahomes's 16-yard TD pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling for a 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
"We have the offence to score touchdowns and I failed to put the team in position to do that," Purdy said.
</P>
<P>
Mahomes and Reid are now halfway to Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, who won six championships in 20 years together with the New England Patriots and were the most recent team to go back-to-back following the 2003-04 seasons.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Mahomes becomes the fourth starting QB to win three Super Bowls â€” joining Brady, Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw and Troy Aikman â€” and second-youngest.
</P>
<P>
Niners wide receiver Jauan Jennings threw a TD pass and caught one, joining Eagles quarterback Nick Foles six years ago as the only players to do both in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
PURDY TO JENNINGS TO CMC FOR SIX ðŸ”¥<br><br>ðŸ“º: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SBLVIII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SBLVIII</a> on CBS<br>ðŸ“±: Stream on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlus</a> <a href="https://t.co/dClcEDViWl">https://t.co/dClcEDViWl</a> <a href="https://t.co/ktiTXIiHzS">pic.twitter.com/ktiTXIiHzS</a>

<P>
After Moody's 53-yard field goal gave the Niners a 19-16 lead with 1:53 remaining, Mahomes and Kelce went to work. Mahomes connected with Kelce for a 22-yard gain to set up Harrison Butker's tying kick, a 29-yarder with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
A holding call on Kansas City's Trent McDuffie extended San Francisco's opening drive of overtime and Purdy made key throws to drive the 49ers to the Kansas CityÂ nine-yard line. But San Francisco settled for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
Mahomes magic
</P>
<P>
Purdy, Christian McCaffrey and the Niners jumped ahead 10-0, but that's no big deal for Mahomes and Kansas CityÂ in the Super Bowl. They've trailed by 10 points in all three of their victories, including last year's 38-35 win over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Mahomes wasn't at his best early and threw an interception. But with the game on the line, he was a magician once again. He finished 34 of 46 for 333 yards and two TDs.
</P>
<P>
MAHOMES MAGIC.<br><br>ðŸ“º: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SBLVIII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SBLVIII</a> on CBS<br>ðŸ“±: Stream on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlus</a> <a href="https://t.co/dClcEDViWl">https://t.co/dClcEDViWl</a> <a href="https://t.co/1ipsjWPW48">pic.twitter.com/1ipsjWPW48</a>

Kansas City wasÂ hardly dominant during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the AFC's No. 3 seed. They won at Buffalo and at Baltimore in the post-season â€” the first road playoff games of Mahomes's career â€” and entered the Super Bowl as 2 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.
</P>
<P>
The game turned when San Francisco's Ray-Ray McCloud couldn't scoop a punt that hit teammate Darrell Luter Jr.'s leg and Kansas CityÂ recovered at the 49ers 16, leading to Mahomes's go-ahead TD pass to Valdes-Scantling.
</P>
<P>
The Niners answered on the next possession with Purdy tossing a 10-yard TD pass to Jennings for a 16-13 lead. Moody's extra point was blocked.
</P>
<P>
Niners coach Kyle Shanahan gambled on fourth-and-threeÂ from theÂ Kansas CityÂ 15, passing up a chance for a tying field goal. Purdy hit George Kittle for a four-yard gain and then found Jennings for the score.
</P>
<P>
WATCH l Super Bowl bets worth billions:
</P>
<P>
Shanahan resorted to trickery for the only touchdown in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Jennings, a wide receiver who had never thrown a pass in an NFL game, tossed a 21-yard TD to McCaffrey. He was hit as he threw, but McCaffrey snagged the wobbly pass across the field and sprinted to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of stars in the building as the NFL brought its biggest game to America's showcase capital. Jay-Z, LeBron James and Paul McCartney were among many celebrities in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Post Malone sang "America the Beautiful," Reba McEntire performed the national anthem and Usher electrified the crowd at halftime. He brought out a number of guests, including Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Jermaine Dupri, Lil Jon and Ludacris.
</P>
<P>
Attendance was announced at 61,629, the smallest crowd in Super Bowl history except for the pandemic game in Tampa, Fla., three years ago.

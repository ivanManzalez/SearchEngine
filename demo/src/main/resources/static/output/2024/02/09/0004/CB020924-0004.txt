Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward received the NFL's Walter Payton Man of the Year award on Thursday night at NFL Honors.

<P>
Prince Harry introduced Heyward.
</P>

This was the sixth time the Steelers nominated Heyward for the award. He created the Heyward House Foundation that supports several initiatives in the Pittsburgh area.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say thank you to the Pittsburgh Steelers for giving me this opportunity," Heyward said. "Mike T (Tomlin), it's an honour to be coached by you. I couldn't play for any other coach. To my teammates, I'm thankful to be your teammate."
</P>
<P>
The foundation also honours his father, Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, a fullback who played 11 seasons in the NFL. He died in 2006 at 39 of brain cancer.

Uber Eats peanut butter gaffe shows how a Super Bowl ad can go awry; 
</P>
<P>
Food delivery company cutting scene that poked fun at peanut allergies

<P>
Uber Eats will apparently remove a scene from its Super Bowl ad that depicts a man having an allergic reaction to peanut butter, following backlash from some consumers and food allergy advocates — a sticky situation that brand experts say could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
The ad starts with a production assistant handing Jennifer Aniston a bag of fresh flowers, lotions and other goodies in a green Uber Eats bag. "I didn't know you could get all this stuff on Uber Eats," the woman says. "I gotta remember that."
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know what they say," Aniston responds, tapping her noggin. "In order to remember something, you've got to forget something else. Make a little room." 
</P>
<P>
It's the setup for a procession of different characters — some celebrities, some not — who forget something significant just so they can remember how much you can order through Uber Eats.
</P>
<P>
Then comes a seconds-long scene in which a man reads the ingredients on a peanut butter jar while waving a spoon around, one eye swollen shut and hives breaking out all over his forehead: "There's peanuts in peanut butter?"
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's the primary ingredient," he says, nodding, mid-anaphylaxis. The ad was released online, ahead of Sunday's big game.
</P>
<P>
Food allergy advocates didn't find it very funny. 
</P>
<P>
The Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) said Friday it was "surprised and disappointed" to see Uber Eats joking about "the disease of life-threatening food allergy."
</P>
<P>
The non-profit group's CEO, Sung Poblete, said later in a note she had spoken with the company, and that it was cutting the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Others also wondered why a food delivery company with allergy-friendly options would joke about an allergic reaction.
</P>
<P>
"It appears to us that Uber Eats doesn't understand this consumer base because if they did, they wouldn't have [chosen] to add this to their clip," Jennifer Gerdts, the executive director of Food Allergy Canada, said of the original version.
</P>
<P>
"I think that for the food-allergic community, they're going to look at this and go, 'Uber Eats doesn't understand me.'"
</P>
<P>
Uber Eats did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CBC News.
</P>
<P>
'Not a smart thing' 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to humour, a brand really needs to identify what's the sandbox they're willing to play in, and what is and isn't funny to them," said Aleena Mazhar Kuzma, senior vice-president and managing director at Fuse Create, a Toronto-based advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
"And I think for Uber Eats, food shouldn't be funny. It's the thing that they most service to consumers, so making a joke out of it is not a smart thing to do."
</P>
<P>
Kuzma said she thought the commercial was otherwise funny and effective, noting that the brand is trying to move away from its reputation as a food-only service to a delivery company that can do it all.
</P>
<P>
Brands like Bud Light and Pepsi have weathered ad-related backlash in recent years that alienated parts of their consumer base. Bud Light, which became a flashpoint in the culture wars last year for its campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, is trying to recover from an ensuing double-digit sales slump.
</P>
<P>
And in 2017, Pepsi infamously pulled an ad with reality star and model Kendall Jenner after a tidal wave of criticism and mockery. The ad showed Jenner offering a police officer a can of Pepsi during a protest meant to evoke the decade's Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Kuzma pointed to other instances where a brand's risk-taking might take off. Ben & Jerry's ice cream "is a great example of a really political brand that takes a lot of risk, and what they talk about, and they're OK with it alienating small communities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 2020 the left-leaning company released a vegan ice cream in honour of Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who had earlier been embroiled in controversy for refusing to stand during the U.S. national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
But for brands like Bud Light and Uber Eats, which are aiming for mass appeal, "you really have to come out with a message that has this sort of universal human insight," she added.
</P>
<P>
"You want everyone to always think of you as a brand that can serve them and service them, and when you start to chip away at that — like with this one tiny scene — it chips away at that, where a group of people don't think you're for them."
</P>
<P>
There's a long precedent of Super Bowl ads being re-edited or removed after public criticism — or in anticipation of that criticism.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Uber Eats might not be the only company scrambling to fix an ad before this Sunday's Super Bowl. Online gambling website FanDuel is reportedly re-editing a commercial that features the late actor and football player Carl Weathers, who died earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Other instances include a 2011 spot by vacation rental company HomeAway called "Test Baby," which featured a rubber baby being thrown against the window of a maternity ward. Some viewers felt it glorified violence against toddlers, which prompted its CEO to apologize and run a re-edited version of the ad in which the baby is caught.
</P>
<P>
Or in 2015, when a GoDaddy commercial that showed a puppy fall off a truck and wander his way home only to be sold by its owner, which led to backlash from animal rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
A Change.org petition with 42,000 signatures calling for that ad's removal was the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl is "a really big stage to take such a big risk when you didn't need to take the risk," said Kuzma.

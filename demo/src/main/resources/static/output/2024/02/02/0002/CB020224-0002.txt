<P>
A U.S. federal judge in Washington formally postponed Donald Trump's March trial on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election as a key legal appeal from the former president continues to work its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Friday vacated the March 4 trial date in the case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith but did not immediately set a new date.
</P>
<P>
The move creates an opening for a separate case in New York, charging Trump in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor, to proceed first.
</P>
<P>
The postponement comes as a federal appeals court has yet to resolve a pending appeal from Trump arguing that he is immune from prosecution for actions he took in the White House.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when the three-judge panel might rule, but a ruling in favour of prosecutors that permits the case to move forward is expected to be appealed by the Trump team, likely resulting in additional delays.
</P>
<P>
For both sides, timing is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
Trump, who faces four indictments and 91 felony counts, is looking to push his criminal cases back as he enjoys front-runner status in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Smith's team, meanwhile, is hoping to be able to prosecute Trump this year before the November election.
</P>
<P>
The Washington case had been expected to take place first, but it has been delayed for weeks by Trump's appeal on immunity grounds.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court heard arguments on Jan. 9, and though it had said it intended to work quickly, has not yet issued a ruling.

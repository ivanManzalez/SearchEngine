Yaroslav Hunka, the man at the centre of the controversy surrounding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's September address to Parliament, was also invited by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to attend a Toronto rally honouring Zelenskyy during his visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Hunka was in the gallery during Zelenskyy's address to parliamentarians and received a standing ovation after then-Speaker Anthony Rota acknowledged the Ukrainian-Canadian for fighting the Russians during the Second World War. Media reports later revealed he fought for Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
An invitation obtained through an access to information request, and first reported by Rebel News, was sent to Hunka to attend a rally in Toronto on the day that Zelenskyy addressed Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was sent on behalf of Trudeau through the Office of Protocol of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office confirmed to CBC News on Monday that Hunka was invited to the rally in Toronto, where Zelenskyy met with members of the Canadian-Ukrainian community. It said that Hunka didn't attend.
</P>
<P>
"Last September, there was a community event with the President of Ukraine in Toronto with over 1,000 people invited. Hundreds of Canadians were invited," a statement from the PMO said.
</P>
<P>
"The individual in question's name was submitted by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. The individual did not attend. Knowing what is known now — the individual shouldn't have been invited."
</P>
<P>
CBC News has reached out to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress for comment.
</P>
<P>
Hunka's invitation to the Toronto event likely will raise new questions about government vetting processes for events featuring foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Rota, who invited Hunka to the House to hear Zelenskyy's address, was forced to resign days after Zelenskyy's visit.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives are placing the blame for the incident squarely on Trudeau and are accusing him of not being truthful about the invitation.
</P>
<P>
"It is appalling and bewildering, although entirely unsurprising, that Justin Trudeau would embarrass our country and undermine our relationship with an ally," Sebastian Skamski, a spokesperson for Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, said in an email.

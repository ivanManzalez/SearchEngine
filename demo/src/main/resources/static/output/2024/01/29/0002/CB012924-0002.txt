San Francisco to face Kansas City in Super Bowl rematch after historic comeback vs. Detroit; 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Kansas City headed back to Super Bowl with win over Baltimore
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Brock Purdy threw for 267 yards and a touchdown, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 17 points down at halftime to beat the visiting Detroit Lions 34-31 on Sunday and reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (14-5) scored 17 points in an eight-minute span of the third quarter to tie the NFC championship game and then pulled away in the fourth quarter to earn a rematch against Kansas City after losing to the clubÂ in the Super Bowl four years ago.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco mounted the fourth comeback ever from 17 points down or more in a conference title game thanks to some big plays by Purdy and bad mistakes from the Lions (14-6), including two failed fourth downs in field-goal range. Detroit fell short of reaching the first Super Bowl in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
After being questioned about whether he could lead a comeback, Purdy has now done it twice in as many weeks. He engineered a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter to beat Green Bay last week and then had an even bigger comeback against the Lions.
</P>
<P>
Christian McCaffrey had two TD runs and little-used backup Elijah Mitchell scored on a three-yard run to make it 34-24 with 3:02 to play as the Niners got over the conference title game hump after losing the past two seasons.
</P>

Mr. Irrelevant is Super Bowl bound ðŸ”¥ <a href="https://t.co/7EQbjqrGe2">pic.twitter.com/7EQbjqrGe2</a>
</P>
<P>
The Niners blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter of the NFC championship game against the Los Angeles Rams two years ago and then were forced to play much of last year's title game loss at Philadelphia without a functioning quarterback after Purdy injured his elbow on the opening drive and fourth-stringer Josh Johnson left with a concussion early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco managed to make the long journey back to this stage and now is in position to deliver the franchise its record-tying sixth Super Bowl title and first since the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
Drought continues
</P>
<P>
A magical season for the Lions ended in heartbreak. Detroit remains the only team to play every season of the Super Bowl era without reaching the ultimate game. This looked like it could be the year to end that drought when Detroit won back-to-back playoff games after winning just one in the previous 56 seasons.
</P>
<P>
But the Lions couldn't finish the job despite holding a 24-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco settled for a field goal on the opening drive of the second half before the game completely flipped in a four-minute span.
</P>
<P>
Detroit coach Dan Campbell opted to go for it on fourth-and-threeÂ from the San Francisco 28, but Josh Reynolds couldn't hold onto a pass from Jared Goff, leading to a turnover on downs.
</P>
<P>
The Lions then seemed to have a potential interception when Purdy's deep pass bit Kindle Vildor in the face mask, but the ball popped up and was caught for a spectacular 51-yard gain by Brandon Aiyuk. Purdy found Aiyuk three plays later for a six-yard score.
</P>
<P>
AIYUK UNBELIEVABLE!<br><br>ðŸ“º: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DETvsSF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DETvsSF</a> on FOX<br>ðŸ“±: Stream on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlus</a> <a href="https://t.co/gm8L5xwa9D">pic.twitter.com/gm8L5xwa9D</a>
</P>
<P>
Jahmyr Gibbs then fumbled on the next play from scrimmage, setting up a one-yard run by McCaffrey to tie the game at 24.
</P>
<P>
It only got worse from there for the Lions with Reynolds dropping another pass on third down, leading to a punt that Detroit had a chance to down at the oneÂ but botched.
</P>
<P>
Purdy then drove the Niners to a 33-yard field goal by Jake Moody and their first lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
Goff added a TD pass to Jameson Williams with 56 seconds to play, but the 49ers recovered the onside kick to seal the win. Goff finished 25 for 41 for 273 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's heralded front seven had no answer in the first half for Detroit's offensive line, which repeatedly opened up big holes, giving the backs several yards even before first contact.
</P>
<P>
The Lions ran for 148 yards in the first half, getting TD runs from Williams, David Montgomery and Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
Michael Badgley added a late field goal to give Detroit a 24-7 lead at the half, tied for the second-biggest scoring output for a road team in the first half of a conference title game since the NFL-AFL merger.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City shuts down Baltimore
</P>
<P>
Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were at their magnificent best in the first half, and Kansas City's defence delivered another masterpiece against Lamar Jackson and host Baltimore, helping Kansas CityÂ reach the Super Bowl for the fourth time in five years with a 17-10 victory in the AFC championship game earlier on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kelce caught 11 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown, and now the big question at next month's Super Bowl in Las Vegas is whether his girlfriend Taylor Swift will be able to make it there in the middle of her tour. The pop star was on hand again Sunday, and the 34-year-old Kelce was at his best.
</P>
<P>
AÂ Super Bowl win over the 49ers on Feb. 11 would make Kansas CityÂ (14-6)Â the first team to win it all in back-to-back seasons since the New England Patriots 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The <a href="https://twitter.com/Chiefs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chiefs</a> are AFC Champions for the 4th time in the last 5 years! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlayoffs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlayoffs</a> <a href="https://t.co/DN7Xpg7Vfz">pic.twitter.com/DN7Xpg7Vfz</a>
</P>
<P>
Kelce broke Jerry Rice's NFL career record for the most catchesÂ in the post-season with his 152nd. He now has 156 in 21 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
Swift's presence has turned Kansas CityÂ into even more of a glamour team than they already were, but it's been more of a blue-collar performance on the field this season. Aside from Kelce, Mahomes hasn't had the receiving playmakers he's enjoyed in years past.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the defence has been a big part of why Kansas City won the AFC West and eventually prevailed in two straight road playoff games against Buffalo and Baltimore to win the conference.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City led 17-7 at halftime, and Justin Tucker's 43-yard field goal with 2:34 to play was the only scoring of the second half. Baltimore kicked deep after that, and on third-and-9, Mahomes connected with Marquez Valdes-Scantling â€” one of his most-maligned receivers â€” on a 32-yard pass that sealed the game.
</P>
<P>
Jackson could win his second MVP after leading Baltimore to the league's best record and point differential during the regular season, but the Ravens allowed touchdowns on the first two Kansas City possessions and appeared a bit panicky at times after that.
</P>
<P>
Baltimore (14-5) made undisciplined mistakes all game, while Kansas City looked the part of the team making its sixth straight appearance in the conference title game.
</P>
<P>
With the Ravens down by 10 in the third quarter, rookie Zay Flowers caught a 54-yard pass to the Kansas City 10 â€” then was flagged for taunting after the play. Moments later, he fumbled near the goal line and the Ravens ended up with no points.
</P>
<P>
That was one of several frustrating moments for Baltimore fans, whose city was hosting an AFC championship game for the first time since January 1971, when the Colts beat the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
Jackson catches own pass
</P>
<P>
Jackson went 20 of 37 for 272 yards and a touchdown, but Baltimore never really exploited its perceived advantage on the ground. Jackson raced under one of his own tipped passes in the first half for a 13-yard reception, but he also turned the ball over twice, including a forced pass into heavy coverage that was picked off in the end zone with 6:45 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
Lamar threw this at the 10 and caught it at the 17 ðŸ˜³<br><br>ðŸ“º: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCvsBAL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KCvsBAL</a> on CBS<br>ðŸ“±: Stream on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlus</a><a href="https://t.co/mZGuyakLrX">pic.twitter.com/mZGuyakLrX</a>
</P>
<P>
Mahomes, meanwhile, competed his first 11 pass attempts, and although the Ravens largely shut Kansas City down after that, the damage was done on a rainy day in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
There was some chippy behaviour before the game, which included Ravens defensive back Arthur Maulet and a group of Kansas City players having to be separated.
</P>
<P>
Then Kansas CityÂ forced a three-and-out on the game's first drive and went 86 yards for the opening touchdown. Kelce caught a 13-yard pass from Mahomes over the middle on fourth-and-two. Then the star tight end beat All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City was unbothered. Mahomes drove his team 75 yards in 9:02 â€” with the help of an acrobatic diving catch by Kelce on one third down toss â€” and Isiah Pacheco capped the 16-play march with a two-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City actually missed chances to extend their lead. A sack by Charles Omenihu forced a fumble by Jackson that gave Kansas City the ball at the Baltimore 33. But Kelce was marked just short on a third down catch, and Pacheco was stopped on the ensuing fourth down at the 13.
</P>
<P>
After a couple of personal fouls on Baltimore helped Kansas City cross midfield late in the half, Kansas CityÂ wasÂ flagged for back-to-back holding calls, the second of which wiped out a 33-yard screen pass to Rashee Rice for what would have been a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
A nine-yard pass to Kelce put Kansas City in position for Harrison Butker's 52-yard field goal that made it 17-7.

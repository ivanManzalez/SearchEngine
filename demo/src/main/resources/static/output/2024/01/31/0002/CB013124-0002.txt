B.C. continues to lead the country in high rental prices and low vacancies, CMHC data shows; 
</P>
<P>
Metro Vancouver leads Canada, but Victoria and Kelowna metro areas are also in the top 5

<P>
When it comes to the rental market, Metro Vancouver continues to be at the top — or depending on how you look at the numbers, the bottom.
</P>
<P>
The annual rental report by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) was released Wednesday, showing data from October 2023 for all major cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Once again, Metro Vancouver led Canada for the highest average two-bedroom rental price ($2,181) and the highest price for a newly rented two-bedroom unit ($2,601), and also had the lowest vacancy rate among the country's major cities (0.9 per cent). 
</P>
<P>
Overall, rents for all buildings increased by an average of nine per cent over October 2022, while the vacancy rate remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a really strong population growth in 2023, and you see in Vancouver, for example, that it kept everything really tight," said Braden Batch, a senior economist with the CMHC.
</P>
<P>
High across the province
</P>
<P>
While Metro Vancouver's numbers attract the most attention in the housing discussion, rents continued to be comparatively high in major population centres across British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth highest rents in the country were in the Victoria ($1,839) and Kelowna ($1,805) metro areas. 
</P>
<P>
The average two-bedroom rents for Abbotsford ($1,483), Chilliwack ($1,430) and Nanaimo ($1,681) all rose higher than inflation in the year to October 2023. 
</P>
<P>
The CMHC report focuses on the average for all rentals, meaning the majority of units counted are those that have been occupied by the same tenant for many years.
</P>
<P>
But they also measure the rental rates for apartment units being turned over — giving the $2,601 figure for Metro Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
'You can't move to the next place'
</P>
<P>
Batch said one of the more noteworthy changes in the statistics from October 2023 was the decline in the number of people who left their rental units. 
</P>
<P>
The number of apartment units in Metro Vancouver with turnover sank from 11 per cent in 2022 to eight per cent in 2023 — one of the lowest numbers in the country, continuing a downward trend seen for many years.
</P>
<P>
"This feeling that people have that you can't move to the next place — it's not just an anecdote, it shows up in that data," said Batch, explaining that more people feel unable to move to a different rental or join the home ownership market compared to the past.
</P>
<P>
"The normal flow of people from rental to ownership is also sort of slowed up, and that's putting added pressure on the rental system."
</P>
<P>
While the CMHC report is not a forecast for future years, Batch expressed some optimism that the continued increase in supply, combined with plateauing home prices, would provide relief to the rental market — eventually.
</P>
<P>
"It might not be a silver lining, but the rental and inflation pressures are starting to ease," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It'll take a couple years before we see that work its way through the rental system and stabilize."

The city broke ground Wednesday morning at the site of the old municipal airport, where it says "one of world's largest sustainable communities", the Blatchford development, will be built.
</P>
<P>
Construction can now begin on the first phase of residential development and on a section of the central park.
</P>
<P>
Once site grading and excavation for the first stormwater pond are complete, the city will start to install underground utilities.
</P>
<P>
"City council has set ambitious goals for this community, and the start of construction is a significant milestone towards achieving their vision for Blatchford," Mark Hall, executive director of the redevelopment project, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"We have an immense opportunity to not only build one of the most environmentally sustainable neighbourhoods in the world, but to also build a community that allows people to live their lives differently."
</P>
<P>
The development plan calls for community gardens and energy-efficient green buildings, along with streets designed for walking and cycling.
</P>
<P>
"Blatchford demonstrates Edmonton's commitment to achieving a healthier, more sustainable and enriched lifestyle for our residents," Mayor Don Iveson said. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime city building opportunity that will allow us to demonstrate extraordinary leadership. Blatchford will become a significant part of the Edmonton story, and will help advance our reputation on a national and international stage."
</P>
<P>
Removal and recycling of old buildings continues on the site.
</P>
<P>
In September, city administration will present council with a proposal that calls for an energy system that would provide high-efficiency heating, cooling and hot water for all the buildings in Blatchford.
</P>
<P>
The first residents could be living in Blatchford by 2016 or 2017, the city said.

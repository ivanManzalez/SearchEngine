Twenty-five years after Swissair Flight 111 crashed near Peggys Cove, N.S., killing all 229 passengers, loved ones of victims and first-responders gathered in Nova Scotia this weekend to mark the sombre occasion. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was Don Jongewaard, who first flew from the U.S. to Halifax to visit the crash site just two days after learning his sister and brother-in-law had died in the 1998 crash. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled his first experience near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
"As I was standing on the rock watching the retrieval in the water, a lone bagpiper came up behind me playing Amazing Grace," Jongewaard said after a candlelight vigil held in Bayswater on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
All these years later, he's hoping to reconnect with an emergency services worker who brought him great comfort in his hour of need.
</P>
<P>
"A young lady … she came up to me and handed me this teddy bear that offered great comfort to me at that particular moment because I was in shock of what happened to 229 souls," he said .
</P>
<P>
"This little guy comforted me for the last 25 years … but I wish to give it back to her this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Jongewaard remains grateful for the support and care he was given in Halifax as he moved through the initial phases of his grief.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to say thank you to the people of Canada, in particular, for everything they've done for us over the years."

Ceremony honours first responders, crash victims
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, a delegation that included Minister of Veteran Affairs Ginette Petitpas Taylor, first responders and family members of those who died in the crash, participated in a ceremony at the Peggys Cove Swissair Memorial in Indian Harbour to remember those lost and commemorate Canada's contribution to the recovery efforts in the wake of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"On the night of September 2, 1998, so many of you rushed into the darkness without even the slightest, slightest hesitation," said Petipas Taylor, speaking to the crowd in front of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
"You had either learned of the news or had heard or seen it yourself and wanted just to go out and to help."
</P>
<P>
Swissair Flight 111 was en route from New York to Geneva, Switzerland when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near the community of Bayswater after crews diverted the plane toward Halifax International Airport when problems were discovered on board.
</P>
<P>
"Even after 25 years, we certainly want the heartbroken families and friends to know that we still remember their loved ones," said Petipas Taylor.

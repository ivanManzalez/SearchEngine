Tidnish is a small and tight-knit community located in Nova Scotia's Cumberland County, near Amherst and the New Brunswick border.

Earlier Monday, Rod Gilroy, president of the Tidnish Crossroads Community Association and a councillor for Cumberland County, said local residents had been stepping up to help, providing food and supplies for first responders at the scene.

"Everybody knows everybody ... they're all connected, whether by friends, family, or by community groups," he said. "It will affect everybody deeply."

In the summer, many people in the community go swimming and boating in local waterways, said Natalie Fisher Spalton, who lives in Tidnish Cross Roads.

"This terrible tragedy certainly makes you pause and think about how important it is not to take anything for granted," she said.

Cumberland District RCMP say they responded to a report Sunday morning from Northport of an overdue person. RCMP officers learned that a 64-year-old man had gone out on his boat on Saturday and had not returned home.

A home is a castle, a retreat — that secure base from which we head out and live, then come back and recharge.

Or it should be.

For a year, CBC Calgary has been digging into the challenges and joys of housing in this city.
</P>
<P>
We invited community members to share their stories by text message. We talked back and for and then used their insight to shape the questions we asked. Many people also chose to share their stories publicly through our reporting.

The text messaging part of this project is now on pause as we plan our next steps. But CBC Calgary reporter Karina Zapata continues to report on housing and renting in Calgary. Email her directly at karina.zapata@cbc.ca.

Several flights between Vancouver and Maui have been cancelled, according to Canadian airlines, as a wildfire tears across the Hawaiian island. 
</P>
<P>
At least six people have been killed as a result of the fire, which has forced residents and tourists alike to flee. Thomson Reuters reports that some people were forced to jump into the ocean to escape the smoke and fire, and winds from a nearby hurricane continued to fan the flames and increase fire behaviour. 
</P>
<P>
A WestJet spokesperson confirmed that two flights from YVR International Airport to Kahului, flight numbers WS1852 and WS1853, were cancelled Wednesday, adding that flights are being rescheduled for Friday, Aug. 11. The airline says it's working to notify passengers of these plans. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Maui wildfires, a travel advisory has been posted on flights and vacation packages and flexible change/cancel guidelines have been announced for all guests travelling to Kahului, Maui, between Aug. 9 and 11, 2023.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make operational changes in the name of safety as necessary," WestJet said. "All guests currently in the region are advised to follow all response instructions provided by local authorities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Air Canada told CBC Wednesday that Tuesday's flight from Maui to Vancouver was cancelled because the fire was impeding access to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We are evaluating other options, including the opportunity to operate an evening flight with a larger aircraft to accommodate all affected passengers, pending airport access and other operational considerations," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Air Canada currently has one flight daily between Vancouver and Maui.

'Confluence of factors'
</P>
<P>
Strong winds and dry conditions have contributed to a perfect storm for wildfire behaviour in Maui, similar to what B.C. has experienced this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kaniela Ing, national director of the Green New Deal Network and former Hawaii state representative, told CBC's On The Coast that hundreds of homes and buildings have been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to bed last night, it was like one building, maybe two buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ing, who was born and raised on Maui, said that growing up, the idea of wildfires sweeping through his community was "absurd."
</P>
<P>
"But now it makes sense. It also is the result of really bad land management by corporate actors who have taken over our politics at times and just developed and took out all the agriculture and the natural vegetation that would buffer against natural disasters," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's like a confluence of factors that I think landed its way to this tragedy."
</P>
<P>
'I'm worried'
</P>
<P>
Kirstie Carlson, who is originally from B.C. but now lives in Kula, Maui, happened to be visiting family on Cortes Island when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
She says her home is very close to where the fire started. Her boyfriend, Mark Klemens, and their six cats fled on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
He texted her to let her know what was going on.
</P>
<P>
"I completely freaked out," Carlson said. "I'm worried."
</P>
<P>
Carlson says Klemens later returned home, where he found their home was safe, but a neighbour's home was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Feeling that the coast was clear, Carlson says Klemens brought the cats back home, only to learn another fire had broke out nearby late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
She said she feels helpless being in B.C. while her boyfriend and neighbours are dealing with the fire.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do."

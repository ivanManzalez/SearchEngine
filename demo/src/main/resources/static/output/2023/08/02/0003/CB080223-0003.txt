<P>
A new program in Guelph will help residential property owners pay for energy efficient upgrades to their properties.
</P>
<P>
The Greener Homes Program will provide zero-interest loans of up to $50,000 to people who qualify.
</P>
<P>
The city says some of the projects that would be considered under the program include: solar panel installations, insulation, window and door repair or replacement, heat pump installations and smart thermostats.
</P>
<P>
There is also a grant of up to $15,000 for low-income applicants to install air source heat pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Ho-Yan, the city's manager of corporate energy and climate change, says the goal is to "help the community reduce emissions in an affordable way."
</P>
<P>
"If each household participates in this, they're taking real action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and playing their part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guelph is part of Race To Zero, a United Nations campaign that mobilizes businesses, cities, regions and investors to become zero carbon by 2050. 
</P>
<P>
Ho-Yan says the city's own goal is to reduce emissions from what it was in 2018 by 63 per cent by 2030.

Similar program in the works for Waterloo region
</P>
<P>
The Region of Waterloo is working on a similar program named RetrofitWR to support homeowners with upfront costs of deep retrofits and renewable installations.
</P>
<P>
With funding from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Reep Green Solutions brought together a working group from area municipalities, local utilities, Conestoga College and the community group ClimateActionWR to explore financing options in the Waterloo region.
</P>
<P>
Mary Jane Patterson, the executive director of Reep Green Solutions, says they recognize energy efficient upgrades are a capital expense, which can be daunting for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
"Those things do cost money, so some people will find it more supportive to have a loan. It helps to spread the expense over a longer time period and they will be saving money on their energy bills to help pay back that loan," Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
Patterson says that while the initial design has been submitted, they still require approval and funding from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to offer it in the next year or two," she said.

Environment Canada has now issued a rainfall warning for all of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
"There remains a fair bit of uncertainty with regards to how this weather disturbance, which is unrelated to Hurricane Franklin passing well to the south, will evolve as it tracks across the province," Environment Canada said in its warning.
</P>
<P>
"As this information becomes clearer, timing and locations of the heaviest rain as well as expected rainfall amounts may change."
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Idalia is expected to hit Florida's west coast Wednesday morning and Hurricane Franklin is southwest of Bermuda, off the Carolinas. Its centre is not expected to make landfall at all in North America and the storm's path will stay east of Atlantic Canada, CBC meteorologist Tina Simpkin said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the National Hurricane Centre is warning of life-threatening surf conditions from Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Simpkin said those powerful waves will continue further north, leading to unpredictable currents and waves that are several metres higher than normal, particularly off Cape Breton.
</P>
<P>
She said that may result in dangerous surf conditions and possible riptides, so people should be cautious swimming along the Atlantic coast into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
While most of the moisture from Hurricane Franklin will stay off the coast, Simpkin said it could mix with two other weather systems, driving up rainfall that was already in the forecast for Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Environment Canada said the rain could be heavy at times. Total amounts could range from 40 to 80 mm, "with locally higher amounts possible."
</P>
<P>
It is expected to start overnight and end from west to east by late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible," Environment Canada noted.
</P>
<P>
"Watch for possible washouts near rivers, creeks and culverts."
</P>
<P>
People should expect lots of rain and thunderstorms — between 50 and 100 millimeters in some areas — with even more in the rain gauge if the moisture from Franklin is involved, Simpkin said.

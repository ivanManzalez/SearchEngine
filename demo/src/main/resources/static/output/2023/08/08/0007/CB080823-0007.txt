No matter where you live, what you do in life, you have a story. And we want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
If you pour concrete to build the tallest towers downtown, what view does that give you on city life? What about your time as a nanny, a teacher or driving a taxi? 
</P>
<P>
Let us walk in your shoes a minute to see new sides of Calgary. Read examples at cbc.ca/AlbertaStories.

Sign up for an upcoming writing workshop
</P>
<P>
There are no workshops currently open for registration. But add your name to our waiting list by emailing Elise Stolte at elise.stolte@cbc.ca. We'll send you a note when new workshops open for registration.

We're hoping to host several more workshops in Calgary during the fall of 2023. We'd also like to take these workshops on the road. If you're from southern Alberta outside Calgary and would like a workshop in your area, send Elise a note and we'll see what's possible.
</P>
<P>
What to expect:
</P>
<P>
Pick a workshop and try to make it to all four sessions. We'll have small writing challenges to help you build your story week by week and give you personal feedback. We'll talk about everything from where to begin, how to use key anecdotes and when a splash of colour can make your story come alive.
</P>
<P>
And don't worry if your English isn't perfect. We're there to support you. By the end, you should have a rough draft you're proud of and, if you like, you can pitch it to cbc.ca/calgary as a freelance contributor to our First Person series — We're hoping you might!
</P>
<P>
These workshops are being held as part of our ongoing partnership with the Calgary Public Library. If you want to join but don't see a workshop that meets your needs, you can join a waiting list by emailing Elise at elise.stolte@cbc.ca.

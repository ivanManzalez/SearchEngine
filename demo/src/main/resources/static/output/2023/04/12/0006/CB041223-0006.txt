<P>
Metro Vancouver mayors and B.C.'s Minister of Housing have announced a new collaborative effort to build affordable housing in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The province, B.C. Housing and the Metro Vancouver Regional District announced Wednesday that they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreeing to construct 2,000 affordable homes over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
A MOU is a legally non-binding agreement to establish a framework for co-operation towards a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement follows the province's recent Homes for People action plan to deliver new homes at a faster rate, which Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon says won't be possible with the work of one tier of government alone. 
</P>
<P>
"This challenge can only be addressed in partnerships with community organizations and all levels of government," said Kahlon at a news conference in Port Coquitlam on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He added the partnership is a "critical" and "historic agreement" that will support Metro Vancouver residents for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement's first phase of projects will create 660 new homes at five sites in Vancouver, Burnaby, Pitt Meadows and Coquitlam. 
</P>
<P>
The province says it will support the initial phase with a $158 million investment over the next three years.

'Housing crisis affects us all'
</P>
<P>
George Harvie, chair of Metro Vancouver's board of directors, says the regional district is contributing money and land valued at $217 million over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
With the region's population expected to increase by a million by 2050, Harvie says the need for housing is more crucial than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We need over 500,000 new homes by then... The housing crisis affects all of us and must remain a top reminder for those of us who are in a position to shape our region's future," he said at Wednesday's news conference, which was held outside the Salal Landing affordable housing project.
</P>
<P>
Surrey Mayor Brenda Locke said the new housing projects will prioritize accessible design for seniors and people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Other features will include shared kitchens, indoor and outdoor gathering areas and gardens, to build a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
Access to safe, affordable housing will improve people's health and wellbeing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows them to focus on other aspects of their life, such as their education, their careers and their families," she said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Port Coquitlam Mayor Brad West says he knows first hand the effect housing security can have on families.  
</P>
<P>
"Raised by a single mom who worked two jobs to raise me and my younger sister, when our housing became more secure, life got a little bit easier," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom had to work a little less hard, stress a little less — although my sister and I gave her other reasons to stress."
</P>
<P>
West says the new initiative is exactly what is needed to address "the most pressing issues we have in our province."
</P>
<P>
'Losing too many young families to other provinces'
</P>
<P>
Harvie said it's critical to revive the livability of the Metro Vancouver region, especially for people struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is undoubtedly most challenging for those with low to moderate incomes, many of whom are facing numerous financial pressures on top of skyrocketing rents," said Harvie. 
</P>
<P>
Kahlon says the province's housing strategy is working to address housing affordability for people with low and moderate incomes through increased availability in the market. 
</P>
<P>
He said this is especially important for young families and new arrivals to B.C. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing too many young families to other provinces because they can't afford it here … we need people for our economy to continue to function … That's why we have to address this challenge head on."
</P>
<P>
The Homes for People action plan and the new agreement fall under the B.C. government's plan to invest $19 billion in housing.

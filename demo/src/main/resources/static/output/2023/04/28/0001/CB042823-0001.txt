'Life's too short' — Calgary's live entertainment industry dials back killer schedule; 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days where the ‘show must go on.’ It's now OK to be sick
</P>

<P>
After years of just talk, performers say Calgary's live entertainment industry has finally dialed back its expectations and demanding schedules.
</P>
<P>
Thank the pandemic for that, says Theatre Calgary director Alex Currie.
</P>
<P>
"It was just kind of a catalyst to help us move it because we were able to just stop for a minute and look at things," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was an industry notorious for working while sick, living up to the saying: The show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Now actors are expected to stay home when they're sick, and Currie says it's common for office staff to be allowed to work from home most days of the week.
</P>
<P>
Plus, actors are now enjoying two days off a week.
</P>
<P>
Currie says that out of the six productions this year, only one went with a six-days-a-week rehearsal schedule; the others were five days a week, five hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"People get two days off a week, they get an (extra) day to deal with life," said Currie.
</P>
<P>
Currie's message that the days of "the show must go on" are over was delivered to the cast of Theatre Calgary's latest production, Jimmy Buffett's Escape to Margaritaville.
</P>
<P>
He told them they're his No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
It's a message that impressed Nathan Gibb Johnson, who just landed one of the main roles in the musical.
</P>
<P>
"A feeling of support that I think is really helpful, and I definitely felt that since Day 1," said Gibb Johnson. "He said, 'we are here to help you do your best.'"
</P>
<P>
While Gibb Johnson settles into his first role with Theatre Calgary, long-time Calgary actor Doug McKeag, who's appeared in roughly 40 of the company's shows, says he's noticed a change, too.
</P>
<P>
Rehearsal schedules are kinder and gentler, easing up on or eliminating what's known as "10 out of 12s," the practice of working 12 hours a day with just two hours of break time. That would sometimes happen six days a week before opening night.
</P>
<P>
"Just the amount of rest and time off, because that becomes really important when you're putting out so much energy into a show," said McKeag.
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt more rested going into a show than this one, and I think it's just because our time is being used very intelligently. So I really appreciate that."
</P>
<P>
Bonding, closeness, checking in
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away at Decidedly Jazz Danceworks, about a dozen dancers run through rehearsal for the company's latest production, Nervous Systems.
</P>
<P>
Kimberley Cooper, the company's artistic director, says the company was able to keep going during the pandemic but on a much smaller scale without live, in-person performances. She says the whole experience brought everyone closer together, people bonded and there was a lot more checking in on everyone's well-being.
</P>
<P>
She says it led to small changes in how they work. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of times when I was dancing full time that I would come to work and I would have bronchitis or the flu and you just muscle through it. We don't do that anymore," she said.
</P>
<P>
She says the performers take more sick days to keep everyone safe.
</P>
<P>
She says the 11-week rehearsal schedule for Nervous Systems saw dancers work mostly regular eight-hour days instead of 12. They only pulled longer shifts in the lead-up to opening night.
</P>
<P>
Company dancer Sabrina Comǎnescu says the change has been a real positive.
</P>
<P>
"You get a little bit more rest, you get a little bit more time to recover. So that always has a positive impact on your dancing," she said.
</P>
<P>
Currie says the changes they've made at Theatre Calgary aren't just for the cast and crew, but also the two dozen or so administrative staff. 
</P>
<P>
Remote work is still allowed, there's more flexibility for employees to deal with personal and family matters and the rules around taking vacations have been eased. 
</P>
<P>
He credits the entire team for making the changes.
</P>
<P>
"I think people just had a chance to pause and think (about) what's important," said Currie.
</P>
<P>
"Life's too short."

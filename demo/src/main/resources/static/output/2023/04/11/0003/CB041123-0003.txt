"Patients are exhibiting some symptoms and that's as much as I have and can share right now," Lamb said, and added anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should avoid visiting a loved one at the hospital.

Only one essential support person per patient will be allowed into the 3 East section of the hospital because of the outbreak.

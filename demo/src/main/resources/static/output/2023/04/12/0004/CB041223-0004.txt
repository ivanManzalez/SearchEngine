The new, $18-million aquatics facility being built at the Halifax Common is set to open to the public this July, along with a modular stage and pavilion, city staff say.
</P>
<P>
The facility will have a 450-person capacity pool with a two-metre deep end, lane swimming and aquatic climbing walls, according to the city's website.
</P>
<P>
The old splash pad will become an updated "water plaza" with fountain sprays and interactive features. The nearby pavilion will feature a year-round community space and kitchen.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a new tree grove and green space beside the splash pad.
</P>
<P>
Construction crews broke ground at the site in April 2022.
</P>

Ryan Nearing, a public affairs adviser with Halifax Regional Municipality, said aim is to create an accessible space that all residents can enjoy. For example, the pool will have a sloped, beach-style entrance, a barrier-free lift and gender-neutral change rooms.
</P>
<P>
"Our real hope is that this will become, and continue to be a central community pillar for the region," Nearing said.
</P>
<P>
There's a newly built playground near the site and funding to build a larger playground is up for approval by regional council later this month in this year's municipal budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
The aquatics facility will also be net zero, powered by solar panels on the roof of the pavilion, Nearing said.
</P>
<P>
Bookings for the stage and community space will open once construction is complete. The municipality is in the process of hiring staff to work at the aquatics facility.

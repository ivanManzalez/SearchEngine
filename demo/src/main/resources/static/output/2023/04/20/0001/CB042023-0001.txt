<P>
William Sandeson must spend at least 7½ more years in prison for the murder of Taylor Samson before he can begin applying for parole.
</P>
<P>
A judge of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court set Sandeson's parole eligibility during a hearing in Dartmouth on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Sandeson of second-degree murder on Feb. 18 of this year. Sandeson, who was just days from starting medical school at Dalhousie University, admitted to killing Samson, a fellow Dal student, on Aug. 15, 2015, in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Sandeson claimed he shot Samson in self-defence — a suggestion rejected by the jury when they convicted him.
</P>
<P>
Samson's body has never been found. Sandeson claimed he dumped the remains into the Salmon River where they were swept into the Bay of Fundy.
</P>
<P>
Justice James Chipman set Sandeson's minimum sentence at 15 years, but since he's been in custody since shortly after the murder, his sentence is being reduced by roughly half.
</P>
<P>
Chipman pointed out that while Sandeson can start applying for parole in 7½ years, there's no guarantee he'll be released then. That decision will rest with the Parole Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Debate over minimum sentences
</P>
<P>
The Crown had asked Chipman to set the minimum sentence at 22 years, but he said that was too high.
</P>
<P>
"It's very upsetting and it won't go away, but I have to be dispassionate," Chipman said, adding that a sentence of that length would be "a direct route to the court of appeal."
</P>
<P>
The judge also rejected a defence request to set the minimum at just 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Before passing sentence, the court accepted victim impact statements from 24 friends and family of Taylor Samson. Only a handful of those statements were read by the people who wrote them.
</P>
<P>
"Since the day Taylor was taken from us, I have been lost, left in a world barely recognizable that has been shaken to its core," Kaitlynne Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
Victim impact statements
</P>
<P>
Samson's friend Gillian Meaney talked about her search for his body, which has never been found. "I drove back and forth to Halifax to Amherst every day," she told the court.
</P>
<P>
"And every day, twice a day I would look on either side of the highway praying to God that I wouldn't find his lifeless body in the ditch somewhere."
</P>
<P>
Samson's mother, Linda Boutilier, declined to comment. She submitted a written statement to the court.
</P>
<P>
"Today I accept the fact that my son has been taken from me," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Today I hate the world with all this evil and cruelty in it."
</P>
<P>
Boutilier said without a body, the only way she can visit her son is at a plaque his Dalhousie University classmates placed outside the physics building on campus.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone tells me I am the strongest person they know," Boutilier wrote.
</P>
<P>
"I am not strong. I hide it well. I am not okay."
</P>
<P>
As she left court, Sandeson's lawyer, Alison Craig, said an appeal was "likely." She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
Crown prosecutors Carla Ball and Kim McOnie said they would have to study the decision to see if an appeal is warranted.

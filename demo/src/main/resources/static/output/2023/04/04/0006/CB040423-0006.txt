A man who Halifax Regional Police say posed as a building management representative in March is facing a series of charges, including sexual assault, break and enter and unlawful confinement.
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the apartment building in the 200 block of the Bedford Highway on March 25. They were told the 24-year-old suspect claimed he was there to do an apartment inspection.
</P>
<P>
They were told that he pushed past the tenant and walked into the unit. When the tenant called the building's management to verify the suspect's identity, he left.
</P>
<P>
When police arrived at the building, they were told the suspect tried to enter another tenant's apartment without permission. He left that apartment after being confronted by the tenant's roommate.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was initially charged with two counts of being unlawfully in a dwelling house and one count of sexual assault. Police later determined a sexual assault had occurred in both instances, and the charges were amended on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The suspect is scheduled to appear in court at a later date.

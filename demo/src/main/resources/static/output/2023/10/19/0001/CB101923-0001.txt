U.S. pines for long-term Mideast peace pact. Step 1: Getting an ambassador to Israel; 
</P>
<P>
Amid backlog of diplomatic vacancies, U.S. Senate tries fast-tracking new Israel envoy
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the mountain of problems in the Middle East, the U.S. is currently grappling with a more modest immediate challenge: it has no ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The key diplomatic post has been vacant for three months, with a career diplomat temporarily running the embassy since the last U.S. ambassador moved back home.
</P>
<P>
It's just one of dozens of ambassadorial vacancies in the U.S. amid Republican stall tactics.
</P>
<P>
Now the parties have agreed to rush the process to fill that one conspicuous gap as violence and geopolitical chaos ripple through the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate held a hearing Wednesday to consider the nomination of Jack Lew, with the majority Democrats pushing for a committee meeting next week to move the process to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said the U.S. needs someone to fulfil several roles: leading embassy staff, supporting Israel in its response to murder, dealing with humanitarian crises and, in the longer term, to push for longer-term peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot overstate the urgency to have a confirmed ambassador on the ground," said Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, which is leading the process.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was interrupted several times by protesters accusing the U.S. of having a one-sided Middle East policy, indifferent to Palestinian civilian suffering.

Pro-Palestinian protesters pressure Biden
</P>
<P>
The hecklers were forced out by security after shouting slogans like, "Our families are dying. We need a ceasefire now," and, "You're funding it.… Genocide in Gaza."
</P>
<P>
It was a taste of the growing pressure on the Biden administration from some progressives and Muslim-Americans. "As a Palestinian-American, and also as somebody of Muslim faith, I'm not gonna forget this," congresswoman Rashida Tlaib told a nearby protest.
</P>
<P>
This was on a day that the Israeli government announced it would allow food, water and medicine to enter Gaza from Egypt, amid pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden.
</P>
<P>
The prospective ambassador echoed a statement made by Biden during his trip to Israel: that after this war, Israelis and Palestinians can't revert to business as usual, and must seek a long-term peace.
</P>
<P>
Both mentioned Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
At his hearing, Lew said he thought he was going to be working on peace initiatives, until the catastrophic events of recent days.

Biden, envoy, renew talk of Palestinian statehood
</P>
<P>
"I dearly pray we get back to that mission soon," said Lew, a former White House chief of staff and U.S. Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
"I have long believed that the path toward a long-term, stable Middle East, and a democratic and Jewish Israel, is a two-state solution. One has to deal with this issue if one is going to be on that path."
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the time is clearly not ripe now, in the midst of war, with Israel torn apart by grief and fury elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he added that some long-term issues must be dealt with after this immediate crisis recedes. In addition to a two-state solution, he mentioned recent efforts at normalizing Saudi-Israeli diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of Hamas's attacks, he said, was to poison that project. In light of that, he said, the negotiating parties had a duty to remain undeterred.
</P>
<P>
"My view is: the way you prevent a terrorist organization from winning is you don't get terrorized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You don't run away. You stick to what's in your national interest; and you work hard at it."
</P>
<P>
He began the hearing by referring to his own Jewish upbringing and the belief that Jewish people around the world can not feel safe without Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he grew up viewing Harry Truman as a hero; he said the former president did not have to recognize Israel, which he did 11 minutes after its founding in 1948, against the advice of his national-security advisers.

WATCH | Biden discusses Palestinian aid deal:
</P>
<P>
Talk of a peace deal is depressingly hypothetical right now, says an analyst of the region.
</P>
<P>
"At this point? Beyond remote, I'm afraid," said Michael Lynk of Western University in London, Ont., a former United Nations rapporteur for human rights in Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, he said, is the U.S. has paid lip service to Palestinian statehood but expended no political energy on it for years.
</P>
<P>
A UN stabilization mission?
</P>
<P>
That includes Biden. Lynk said the president talks about a two-state solution but without conviction. Lynk lamented that the last significant Israeli-Palestinian peace talks occurred almost a decade ago under then-secretary of state John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
The likeliest first step, Lynk said, would be a UN security presence in Palestinian territories as happened in Kosovo, the Balkans and East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
This would, he said, buy time for new Palestinian leadership to emerge and for international pressure to build on Israel to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
As evidence of how far apart the sides are right now, he pointed to the logjam over simpler issues in the Saudi-Israeli normalization talks.
</P>
<P>
Saudis reportedly wanted the largest piece of the West Bank, Area C, currently administered by Israel and dotted with settlements, transferred to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
There's no Israeli appetite for that, Lynk said – let alone for meeting Palestinian demands like a contiguous state based on pre-1967 borders; an end to settlements; and control of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This is anathema to the present Israeli cabinet and the present Israeli government," he said
</P>
<P>
Lew's confirmation to the role is likely; it could happen with Democratic votes alone, as his party holds a majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, have expressed skepticism about his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Several accused Lew of misleading this same committee in 2015 when he insisted Iran would not access U.S. funds under terms of a now-moribund nuclear deal.
</P>
<P>
His department did, in fact, try and fail to help Iran convert funds in an Omani bank, through New York, into $5.7 billion US.
</P>
<P>
"We need [the position] filled," said the top Republican on the committee, its former chair James Risch. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have is it needs to be filled with the right person. I have some issues in that regard."

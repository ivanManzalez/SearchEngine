N.S. government releases 5-year housing plan; 
</P>
<P>
Opposition MLAs say plan is 'underwhelming' and lacks detail
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nova Scotia's housing minister released a five-year strategy on Monday that he says represents at least $1 billion in provincial government spending and will create conditions to build at least 41,200 housing units. But opposition politicians did not see enough detail to have confidence in that projection.
</P>
<P>
John Lohr said releasing the plan and the provincial housing needs assessment speaks to the magnitude of the problem facing the province, and the work that needs to happen to create more housing that is affordable.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize there is a massive need," the minister told reporters during a news conference in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
"This is a call to action for us."
</P>
<P>
The strategy outlines steps the government has already taken, and will take in the next five years to address the housing crisis. Vacancy rates have been hovering at about one per cent across the province, while rents and home purchase prices have also been experiencing double-digit percentage increases.
</P>
<P>
In 2022-23, the province spent $266 million on housing. Lohr's announcement Monday of $1 billion would represent average annual spending lower than that for the next five years, although the minister said he expected the province to exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
80,400 new units needed in 10 years
</P>
<P>
Using population modeling from the province, the housing needs assessment says it will take about 80,400 new units in the next 10 years to meet anticipated demand. A growing number of people surveyed for the assessment reported having to forgo things such as food and recreation in order to pay their housing costs. Others reported that they could no longer afford to buy a home.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 per cent of couples, six per cent of lone parents and two per cent of single people earn the annual income of $130,000 or more required to afford median single or semi-detached homes, according to the needs assessment.
</P>
<P>
Changing that trend will take effort from all levels of government, the private sector and not-for-profit organizations, said Lohr.
</P>
<P>
The needs assessment found that if the government met its five-year targets, vacancy rates would increase to three per cent and housing costs would return to 2016 levels, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
"It's about all of us working together. We all play important roles in the provision of housing and must work together to make significant change."
</P>
<P>
Reports for each municipality
</P>
<P>
As part of the housing needs assessment, each of the province's 49 municipalities received a report focused on the needs of their respective communities. The province did not release those reports, saying it would be up to each municipality to do so.
</P>
<P>
The five-year strategy largely highlights steps the government has previously announced and plans to build upon, such as creating 222 new public housing units, tabling sweeping legislation to give Lohr more direct control over development in Halifax Regional Municipality, designating provincial land for housing development, removing the provincial portion of HST from new apartment construction costs, and creating a program that provides funding for people who build secondary suites on their property.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was developed following public consultations that heard from more than 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Lohr said to make the change that's necessary across the province, people must be open to ways to create more housing where it's needed.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to set aside not-in-my-backyard sentiments," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of where you stand, the expectation is clear: we need more homes, we need more collaboration and partnership, we need more investment."
</P>
<P>
Opposition skeptical
</P>
<P>
Opposition MLAs said they didn't see much in the documents to give them confidence the government is on track to tackle the housing crisis.
</P>
<P>
Liberal MLA Braedon Clark called the government's strategy "underwhelming."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's less of a strategy and more of a summary of ideas," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see much new information or money in here that's going to make a difference for people anytime soon."
</P>
<P>
New Democrat MLA Suzy Hansen said the documents released Monday are "a lot of words and not a lot of action."
</P>
<P>
"It's really vague and we find that with the government a lot when it comes to these announcements," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They like talking about the things that they throw money at, but [as for] doing the action that makes the things happen — we don't see much of that."
</P>
<P>
Labour an issue
</P>
<P>
Angela Bishop, executive director of the Housing Trust of Nova Scotia, said the report is a "restatement of commitments" the government has delivered in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"These programs are making a dent in the housing challenge," she said in an interview, but "not fast enough and not as great an impact as we need."
</P>
<P>
Investment in the non-profit sector in the next five years would have longer-term benefits, said Bishop, because their focus is on housing that remains affordable.
</P>
<P>
"There's only so much affordability the private sector can offer," she said. "The non-profit sector is built without a profit motive; we're built to provide support services, affordability to residents across the province."
</P>
<P>
Bishop said efforts to speed up the planning and rezoning process in municipalities across the province — the way the provincial government has already done with Halifax Regional Municipality — could lead to the faster development of projects such as modular housing to house people who have no other options, or health-care workers trying to relocate but struggling to find housing.
</P>
<P>
"There's a great need, and five years is a long walk. We have people who are in need now," she said.
</P>
<P>
The availability of labour presents a challenge to making good on the government's plan, Lohr said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the province announced efforts to get more people working in the skilled trades.
</P>
<P>
"To really solve this housing crisis, ultimately, we need to solve the skilled crisis, as well."
</P>
<P>
Student housing strategy still in the works
</P>
<P>
Clark speculated that Monday's event was scheduled by the government in the face of political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Despite being due last spring, Lohr said last week that the government had decided not to release the documents. Premier Tim Houston defended the decision at the time by saying members of the public want to see action, not government plans.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Lohr said Houston had changed his mind and asked him if the reports could be released. The minister said staff in his department produced the documents with the most current information possible.
</P>
<P>
He reserved the right to take other measures not included in the plan if it's determined that it could help the housing landscape.
</P>
<P>
The release of the documents on Monday means two of the three key reports the province has touted to help confront the housing crisis are now public. Its student housing strategy is overdue and remains in development.
</P>
<P>
Advanced Education Minister Brian Wong told reporters last week that work on the strategy continues, but he could offer no timeline for its release.

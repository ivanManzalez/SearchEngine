Rental scams 7th on list of riskiest scams in Canada: Better Business Bureau 2022 Scam Tracker Risk Report

A woman from Prince George, B.C., is ringing the alarm about online scammers, after receiving what she described as several fraudulent messages while she and her husband were looking for a home to rent in Kamloops. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, Rita Wiebe and her husband, Bill, posted on the classified ad site Kijiji, stating they were looking for a two-bedroom home to rent starting Dec. 1. Wiebe said she included her phone number in the ad.
</P>
<P>
To her surprise, she said, she was immediately inundated with messages through the platform, as well as calls and text messages directly to her number, from people saying they have a place she could rent.
</P>
<P>
"I come from an area where I just believe in trusting people and you know Prince George and Kamloops are very similar," Wiebe told host Shelley Joyce on CBC's Daybreak Kamloops.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the people reaching out to her, Wiebe said she quickly realized many of them were trying to scam her.
</P>
<P>
"I spent so much time on a wild goose chase," she said, adding most of the calls came from numbers with U.S. area codes.
</P>
<P>
Rental scams ranked seventh on a list of the riskiest scams in Canada in Better Business Bureau's 2022 Scam Tracker Risk Report, costing people a median amount of $1,600.
</P>
<P>
The 2022 list also marks the first time rental scams made the top 10 ranking, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
'I don't have anybody to show the place'
</P>
<P>
Wiebe said one person asked her to send some money to fill out an application.
</P>
<P>
Another person sent a photo of his passport, including personal information and what he described as a property title.
</P>
<P>
The man included photos of the home's interior and an application form.
</P>
<P>
In email correspondence between Wiebe and the man, shared with CBC News, the man mentioned he had just relocated to Florida for a new job.
</P>
<P>
Wiebe asked if she could talk to someone in person to visit the property.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anybody to show the place at all, the new job I got here came as an emergency so I had to take the keys and all documents along with me," the man replied over email.
</P>
<P>
Wiebe said she eventually discovered the home had been listed for sale by a Kamloops-based real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
'In most cases, fraudsters say they are out of the country'
</P>
<P>
According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC), fraudsters often create classified ads for property rentals in highly sought-out locations.
</P>
<P>
"In most cases, fraudsters say they are out of the country. As a result they are looking to rent the property quickly and to a good person," said spokesperson Jeff Horncastle.
</P>
<P>
The fraudsters then say they are unable to show the home in person, Horncastle said. 
</P>
<P>
Wiebe said she has become more assertive about asking for local phone numbers and people she could meet to show her the homes in person — but when she does, people would stop replying. 
</P>
<P>
On its website, Kijiji asks users to report a sender's email address and any related information to their customer service team if they receive a seemingly suspicious or fraudulent message through the platform. 
</P>
<P>
Wiebe said she has not reported those user accounts after they stopped responding. She and her husband are still looking for a place to rent in Kamloops.
</P>
<P>
CBC News has reached out to Kijiji for this story.
</P>

To avoid getting scammed, the CAFC recommends renters to:

The CAFC also recommends reporting potential scams to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (1-888-495-8501), the RCMP or your local police.

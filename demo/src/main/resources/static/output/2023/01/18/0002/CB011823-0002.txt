Where is old man winter? 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, it's a question I'm getting asked a lot these days.
</P>
<P>
No snow
</P>
<P>
By comparison, it's been a very slow start to winter across mainland Nova Scotia with just six centimetres of snow recorded at Halifax airport, 13 cm at Yarmouth and 54 cm at Greenwood.

Warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic have been a factor and the lower snowfall totals near the coastline, versus northern areas, is good evidence of that. Any snowy systems that have tracked through have quickly mixed to rain along the warmer coastline.   The 6 cm of snow at Halifax is a record low for mid-January, by a long shot.   The winter of 1979-1980 was the previous lowest start for snow and is currently the record holder as the least snowy winter season overall in Halifax. By the end of that winter, only 102 cm had been recorded at Halifax airport. Just 72 cm of snow fell at the Citadel downtown.

It's not over until it's over
</P>

The now infamous winter of 2014-2015 is the greatest example of a winter in which the snow started out with a trickle and ended with a torrent.  That winter, just 66 cm of snow had fallen by the end of January, but that pattern shifted and the storms started rolling in. Halifax picked up 131 cm of snow in February and 147 cm in March. There was snow on the ground until the end of April.

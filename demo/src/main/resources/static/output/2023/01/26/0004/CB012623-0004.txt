Another storm is getting set to roll into the Maritimes with heavy snow, ice pellets, freezing rain and heavy rain Thursday. The incoming system will also bring strong southerly winds with the potential to cause power outages.
</P>
<P>
For Nova Scotia, this will again primarily be a rain and wind event. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread wind warnings and rainfall warnings are in effect for most of the province.
</P>
<P>
We'll see snow arriving through Wednesday night, with some light, accumulating snow on the leading edge of the system.
</P>
<P>
Inland and northern areas could pick up a trace to five centimetres overnight and into Thursday, leading to a slick morning commute for some areas.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures will rise quickly on Thursday, with high-single and low-double digits on tap for the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
With rain at times heavy — totals of 20 to 50 millimetres and up to 70 millimetres along the Atlantic coast — localized flooding will be a possibility yet again.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rain, southerly winds will be howling with this storm. Widespread gusts of 70 to 100 km/h are looking likely, with the strongest gusts set for coastal areas and over higher terrain.
</P>
<P>
Similar strength wind storms have led to some power outages, so be prepared for that possibility on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Environment Canada is also warning of higher than normal water levels along the Atlantic coastline on Thursday, particularly in the Yarmouth and Shelburne areas. 
</P>
<P>
The rain and wind will ease from west to east across the region on Thursday evening and overnight, with cooler and calmer weather moving in on Friday.

British Columbia continues to be the most expensive place to be a renter in the country, according to new data released by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Metro Vancouver area once again topped the list of the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a purpose-built development at $2,002.
</P>
<P>
The next closest metro area is more than $200 lower, with Toronto at $1,779. 
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth most expensive metro areas were also in B.C., with Victoria at $1,669 and Kelowna at $1,690.  
</P>
<P>
Overall, the average price of a two-bedroom apartment across all B.C. communities with at least 10,000 people was $1,721, up 11 per cent from 2021 and the highest figure in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vacancy rate in British Columbia was 1.3 per cent, down from 1.4 per cent last year and the lowest in the country outside Atlantic Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bond, a senior specialist with the CMHC, said the increased prices are tied to tight rental markets and inadequate supply.
</P>
<P>
"When demand for rental is exceeding supply, it creates conditions when rents can increase particularly upon turnover," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting dynamic that is taking place there, but all of this comes back to having a shortage of rental in B.C."
</P>
<P>
The annual CMHC report is the only systematic national analysis done annually. For 2022 it included data looking at the increase in rents after someone had moved out of a unit.
</P>
<P>
In those situations, the average two-bedroom unit in British Columbia increased in rent from $1,742 to $1,927 — a 11 per cent increase. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the average asking rent for vacant units owned privately jumped significantly to $2,373, a 43 per cent increase over the average price of occupied units at $1,658.
</P>
<P>
Bond said that one bright spot in B.C. was that 3800 new purpose-built rental units had been completed in the Metro Vancouver region, the highest number since they started compiling the figures in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But he said more needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very welcome development, but the vacancy rate still decreased … that means we continue to need more rental supply."
</P>
<P>
Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim agrees.
</P>
<P>
"We have an issue. We're seeing it now. We do not have enough supply. We have a lot of demand, so we have to build a lot more," he said.

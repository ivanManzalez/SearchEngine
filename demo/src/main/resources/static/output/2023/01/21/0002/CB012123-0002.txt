Further expansion of virtual care 'imminent,' Nova Scotia Health president says; 
</P>
<P>
Karen Oldfield says goal is to provide virtual care to any Nova Scotian who wants it
</P>

<P>
Even more changes are in the works for Nova Scotia's health-care system, as it struggles to cope with overcrowded emergency departments and an ongoing lack of family physicians.
</P>
<P>
Karen Oldfield told a business audience Friday that the slate of changes announced by the provincial health minister earlier this week are not the only ones being planned or contemplated.
</P>
<P>
"We're full speed ahead on [virtual care] — as in imminent — [the] next couple of months," Oldfield said about a further expansion of the service, which is only available to some Nova Scotians.
</P>
<P>
Virtual care can be accessed online for free by the 130,000 Nova Scotians on the province's Need A Family Practice Registry. People can go online to book an appointment with one of the dozens of physicians or nurse practitioners who provide virtual consultations.
</P>
<P>
Appointments are generally conducted via a video call on a desktop or laptop computer, tablet or smartphone equipped with a camera and microphone. 
</P>
<P>
The virtual care program can also be accessed at hospital emergency departments in Truro, Port Hawkesbury and Yarmouth.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the province announced other emergency departments would soon be able to offer virtual consults with emergency physicians.
</P>
<P>
Oldfield took that a step further in responding to a question about virtual care from Patrick Sullivan, the president of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Oldfield said, when asked what she thought of virtual care. "This is under the 'go-like-hell category' because the premier loves it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Oldfield said expanding the service is possible thanks to a plan to add physicians from outside the province who are licensed to practice in Nova Scotia to the virtual-care roster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the luncheon, Oldfield said the goal is to be able to offer the service to any Nova Scotian who wants it.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at that as we speak and so it's really just a question [of] determining the right provider and moving forward with the right technology," said Oldfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great system, it needs to scale and I'm looking at [the] first [fiscal] quarter for that."
</P>
<P>
Oldfield said giving all Nova Scotians a shot at booking virtual medical appointments might take some time.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be the minute we push the switch, but that will be the plan," said Oldfield.
</P>
<P>
That commitment seemed to catch Thompson off guard when reporters asked her about expanding the service to all Nova Scotians. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard from people again and again that they like virtual care, particularly for episodic complaints, and so I think there's opportunity for us to expand and look at that in the future but there's nothing imminent," said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of private-public partnerships
</P>
<P>
Oldfield and Thompson were on the same page when it came to support for expanding health-related public-private partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed to the larger scope of work pharmacists have been afforded to provide care to Nova Scotians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would be remiss if we didn't look for those opportunities throughout the province, using very responsibly taxpayers' dollars in order to improve care," Thompson told the audience Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the Houston government would be open to discussing other "mutually beneficial" public-private partnerships in the delivery of publicly funded health services. 
</P>
<P>
Oldfield took that a step further, suggesting physiotherapists or private physiotherapy clinics might offer an "awesome" and "fantastic" partnership opportunity.
</P>
<P>
She later expanded on that thought when asked by reporters what she had in mind.
</P>
<P>
"If there's a way to have a private operator provide a physical space and we can put people in there, if we can put patients or those needing care into a physical space that the public purse still pays for, that's smart," she said.
</P>
<P>
New Democrat MLA Susan Leblanc was puzzled by the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"If we can put, you know, publicly funded and universally funded health-care workers into an office that is owned by someone, I feel like that might be a good way to get offices open," said Leblanc.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is though, is that we don't have the people to put in those offices and that is the actual problem."

Most British Columbians will soon see a little extra money in their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
The latest cost-of-living credit announced by Premier David Eby in November is expected to arrive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance says 85 per cent of British Columbians will receive a full or partial B.C. Affordability Credit from the Canada Revenue Agency, which will provide as much as $164 per adult and $41 per child.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Katrine Conroy says British Columbians' budgets are already stretched, and the credit will help combat rising costs.
</P>
<P>
"We know it won't cover all the bills, but hopefully, this little extra from the B.C. Affordability Credit will help take a bit of the pressure off as we head into a new year," she said.
</P>
<P>
As of November 2022, B.C.'s consumer price index was up 7.2 percent compared to the same time in 2021.
</P>
<P>
In November, along with the B.C. Affordability credit, Eby also announced a one-time, $100 B.C. Hydro credit.
</P>
<P>
The utility service says the credit was automatically applied to customers' bills in December.
</P>
<P>
The province says B.C. families will also receive the first of three enhanced B.C. Family Benefit payments on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
The three payments will be sent out in January, February and March, providing up to an additional $58.33 per child each month.
</P>
<P>
"We're focused on helping the people and families who need it most right now, and we are in a strong position to continue this support," Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of November, former finance minister Selina Robinson revealed that B.C. was sitting on a surplus of $5 billion.

<P>
The financially troubled Village of Baddeck is waiting for word on its fate after a Nova Scotia government deadline passed to straighten out its administration and finances.
</P>
<P>
Village officials were unable to complete all of the tasks ordered by Minister of Municipal Affairs John Lohr, but they are confident they have things under control.
</P>
<P>
"The ones that could be completed have been completed," said Sandy Hudson, the village's interim chief administrative officer. "Some of them, for instance the financial statements, there is a problem that there are no records, that our accountants can't put anything together, so they probably will just wind up doing a review of those years and ... until we have a financial statement for 12 months, they can't start that water rate study."
</P>
<P>
The Cape Breton village has been rocked by scandal since its former CAO, Megan Cooper, was fired and Maris Freimanis — who retired as CAO of Richmond County and was formerly with the Town of Port Hawkesbury — was brought in to run things on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
He found financial records missing and discovered that audited financial statements required by the province had not been done.
</P>
<P>
Following an RCMP investigation, Cooper was charged with a single count of fraud and this week pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the minister ordered the village to hire a new clerk/treasurer (similar to a chief administrative officer), a finance clerk and a public works supervisor.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the village to submit plans on collecting taxes and sewer and water payments, a new water rate study and several years of audited financial statements — all by Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
The village has sent a report to the minister noting they failed to produce two years of audited financial statements and the water rate study.
</P>
<P>
Missing and partial financial records
</P>
<P>
Hudson — who previously retired as CAO of Victoria County — said there are simply no financial records for the 2019-20 fiscal year and only partial records for the following year.
</P>
<P>
"It is a huge problem and it has been for the last two years, basically trying to reconstruct, [to] find out who paid what and who didn't pay what," he said.
</P>
<P>
After last year's annual general meeting, the village was forced to raise taxes and sewer rates and has been told it must raise water rates, but that requires a study and approval from the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.
</P>
<P>
Permanent manager sought
</P>
<P>
Financial statements are required for a UARB hearing, said Hudson, but with two years unable to be certified by auditors, accountants are preparing a less-intensive financial review that will be used to conduct the water rate study.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the village's elected commissioners are ready to hire a permanent manager.
</P>
<P>
They have conducted interviews and made a tentative offer, but don't want to finalize it until they hear from the province.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we know what the future holds for our ministerial order status, then they'll go forward with that," Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
"We just don't think it's fair to bring somebody on now and then a new ministerial order comes out and we don't know what it's going to say."
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, the commissioners are feeling good about the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sorting out revenue problems
</P>
<P>
There is money in the bank and the revenue problems have been sorted out.
</P>
<P>
"I think they're positive going forward," Hudson said. "We can do it. We've been here for 114 years. We can keep going."
</P>
<P>
In an email, the Department of Municipal Affairs said it is reviewing the latest report and will follow up with the village on next steps.

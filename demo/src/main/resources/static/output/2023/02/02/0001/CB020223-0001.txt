Organizations in the Yukon are reacting to big changes for tenants and landlords, including a long called-for ban on no-cause evictions that came into effect overnight.
</P>
<P>
The new confidence and supply agreement (CASA) between the Yukon's Liberals and the territory's NDP includes significant changes in rental regulations — and while some advocacy organizations welcome the policies, other groups say it's too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
Emily Tredger, housing critic for the Yukon NDP and MLA for Whitehorse Centre, celebrated the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
"We are so so proud of this agreement and of what it's going to do, in particular for tenants," she said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations prohibit landlords from evicting tenants without providing a reason. Until this week, the Yukon was one of the only places in Canada where that was allowed.
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking yesterday and today of people, in particular of a woman I met who was being evicted. She was a senior, and she had been living in her home for over 10 years, and she was evicted with no reason given," Tredger said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'it's too late for me. But I hope that I can make a difference for people in the future.' And you know what? She's done it."
</P>
<P>
'Greater justice for tenants'
</P>
<P>
The new CASA also includes a commitment to initiate a review of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act by June of this year and adds more stipulations around yearly rental increases.
</P>
<P>
Kate Mechan, executive director of the Yukon's Safe at Home Society, said she's happy to see greater protections for tenants included in the new CASA.
</P>
<P>
The Safe at Home Society had included a ban on no-cause evictions and a review of the act in its list of 10 calls to action released in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We were calling for these actions because we're really seeing the disproportionate impact that no cause evictions in particular (were) having on vulnerable community members," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It also follows suit with what the rest of the country is doing. So that will mean that we're following suit with greater justice for tenants."
</P>
<P>
Concerns about rent cap
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is happy about the changes.
</P>
<P>
Lars Hartling, president of the Yukon Residential Landlord Association, said he's worried about how the ban will affect people who own rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
Hartling opposes additional regulations for evictions. He also takes issue with the new guidelines on rental increases. Like in the previous CASA, landlords can raise rent once a year in accordance with changes to the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
But the new CASA adds a minimum and maximum rate for rent increases, stipulating rent cannot be raised more than five per cent annually even if the rate of inflation exceeds that.
</P>
<P>
"We're living through a unique time of almost hyperinflation," Hartling said. "Which, of course, just means that the landlords will be having to carry those costs."
</P>
<P>
Tredger said the cap on rent increases is to protect tenants from bearing the brunt of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Hartling also noted it's been hard for landlords to adjust to changes that haven't gone through the typical legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
"Our organization is shocked that we're at this point," Hartling said.
</P>
<P>
The ban on no-cause evictions and changes to the rent cap were brought into effect immediately through orders in council that amended the regulation.
</P>
<P>
"They say in the CASA agreement they want to consult in early summer," Hartling said, referring to the planned review of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. 
</P>
<P>
"How can they consult in good faith when they've already enacted the rules that we have to play by?"
</P>
<P>
Ben Pereira, a director at the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber had several concerns about the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We would not like to see the government creating prohibitive new regulations around rent controls…or how tenants and landlords can contract amongst themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira suggested the Yukon government should focus on investing in social housing and increasing housing supply to ease the tight rental market instead of creating more regulations.

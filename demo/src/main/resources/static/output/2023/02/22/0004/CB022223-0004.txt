Nova Scotia RCMP say they have arrested two people in connection with the homicide of Andrew Carter Morris, after a dramatic scene in Eskasoni on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Morris, 30, was found dead on Beach Road in Eskasoni in August 2021. His murder was added to the province's unsolved crime rewards program last year.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two individuals were arrested after executing a search warrant at a residence on Seventy Fourth Street on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Several officers and a heavily armoured police vehicle blocked off the area. RCMP told CBC News they were not allowed past because tear gas had been released.

Fire at house being searched
</P>
<P>
Shortly after speaking with officers, CBC News saw a drone fly into the house through an open window.
</P>
<P>
Police did not evacuate the neighbourhood, so a handful of people living nearby took out their cellphones and started recording the tense situation.
</P>
<P>
During the search, the house caught fire. It's not clear what started the blaze.
</P>
<P>
Around the time of the fire, a man was taken into custody. RCMP said another person was also arrested.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear what — if any — charges they will face.
</P>
<P>
Marina Young, a lifelong resident of Eskasoni, lives across the road from the house where the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon, she told CBC News the situation had been ongoing for about four hours.
</P>
<P>
"We're basically blocked out of our driveway. Yes, it's for our safety too, because the fire is just out of control really right now," Young said.
</P>
<P>
"We woke up this morning to the dog barking and we could hear loud bangs and pops, and I looked out the window right away, and I saw the SWAT team in the driveway and a bunch of cars lined up on the street and police cars. So I knew there was something going on with our neighbours."
</P>
<P>
Young said she packed up her children and left the area to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't sure if there would be stray bullets or anything happening."
</P>
<P>
She said she's not worried about the fire spreading to her home but is concerned for her neighbours' homes.
</P>
<P>
"There are kids on both sides ... we wouldn't want their homes to burn or anyone to be caught in any kind of trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were still on the scene by mid-afternoon on Wednesday.

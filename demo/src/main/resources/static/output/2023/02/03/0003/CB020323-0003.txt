Temperatures across the province are expected to drop well into the –20s this weekend. That's worrying people living rough — and those who work with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality of –25 degree weather is that people really could die outside," said Campbell McClintock, a street outreach worker with Out of The Cold Community Association in Halifax. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock spent this week responding to texts and calls from community members concerned about the upcoming cold temperatures and blowing winds which will make the weather feel much colder. He delivered blankets, tarps, sleeping bags and propane to try and keep people warm.
</P>
<P>
He also helped people set up new tents. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll be doing the same for the rest of the week until the deep, deep, cold hits," he said. "I feel that still not enough is being done and tents are absolutely not the solution. Housing is the only solution."
</P>
<P>
ALL DONATIONS received between Monday, Jan. 30th to Tuesday, Feb. 7th, will go directly to our <a href="https://twitter.com/OTC_outreach?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OTC_outreach</a> budget to be used to provide essential survival gear &amp; supplies to folks forced to sleep rough during WEATHER EMERGENCIES.<a href="https://t.co/TV06scd00M">https://t.co/TV06scd00M</a> <a href="https://t.co/COL4kEYRMA">pic.twitter.com/COL4kEYRMA</a>
</P>
<P>
McClintock said shelters are also not the solution, even as a stopgap measure, because they're usually full.
</P>
<P>
He said he's working with growing numbers of people who have been evicted and can't find an affordable place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan MacLean has been living in a tent covered by a tarp in downtown Halifax. He hopes to get a bed overnight in the Metro Turning Point shelter on Barrington Street, but says what he really needs is housing.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty difficult," MacLean said. "It's cold, wet. One of the hardest things is when you get wet, you can't really dry yourself out."
</P>
<P>
After being injured on the job, he can no longer work. But he said income assistance doesn't match rising rental costs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked my whole life and it's tough not being able to work," he said. "And [income] assistance is nowhere near enough to live....  Any housing is like $900 for a room in a place, so it's tough."
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, Bill MacQueen said he has been living on the street for 12 years, seeking shelter wherever he can.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, he spent the night in an ATM vestibule.
</P>
<P>
"I used to sleep behind the fire station here on the grate, or across from the building there's a little doorway and they told me I couldn't do that no more," he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Jim Gunn with Beacon House in Lower Sackville, N.S., said the shelter usually has 20 beds, but this weekend will increase to more than 30. 
</P>
<P>
"As we have in other storms, we are going to run the centre all weekend," Gunn said. "Normally it closes ... from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. each day. But when it's bad weather, we keep it open."
</P>
<P>
Christine Porter, executive director for the Ally Centre of Cape Breton, said their building on Prince Street will be open for those who cannot stay in the community shelter.
</P>
<P>
She checked in on several people on Thursday and found they had survived after the temperature dropped to -15 C on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Some are living in tents and others use heating grates and doorways when they can.
</P>
<P>
"There's a couple of more that I haven't seen yet today, but they made it through the night," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This weekend in particular is, you know, with the temperatures that we're expecting, they have to have shelter or they won't make it."

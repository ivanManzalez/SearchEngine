The redevelopment of Shannon Park will proceed after it was approved by Harbour East Marine Drive community council Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The site's owner, Canada Lands, promises 20 per cent of the housing will be affordable.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes 3,000 new residential units, a transit hub and two large parks. Canada Lands, a federal Crown corporation, will be selling parcels of land to other developers starting next year.
</P>
<P>
"I will support this wholeheartedly, it's a good plan and it's been a long time coming," said Coun. Sam Austin ahead of the vote Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
But Austin said the province and federal government must help to make the affordable housing bit happen.
</P>
<P>
"They need to be involved in Shannon Park, working on that development to create those units in the space rather than just expecting the developer and the non-affordable units in there to carry the whole societal freight of that crisis that we're in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need to be contributing, and the way to do that is how we do collective stuff — it's through government."
</P>
<P>
Public support
</P>
<P>
Several members of the public spoke in support of the project.
</P>
<P>
Patty Christie lived in Shannon Park in the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with Canada Lands' vision for a new community, a community consisting of residential retail space coupled with parks and outdoor recreation areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
"There will never be another Shannon Park as I know it and I applaud Canada Lands' commitment to create something similar."
</P>
<P>
Christie said the 3,000 planned units are "desperately needed" even though she might not be able to afford to live there.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just as important to have more housing in HRM," she said.
</P>
<P>
Permanent affordable housing
</P>
<P>
Maura Donovan, who lives in downtown Dartmouth, said the affordable housing built needs to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
"Something that's affordable for 20 years, it's awful, there's nothing good about that," she said. "It's a poor investment in terms of public money to have things be affordable for a very short period of time in the life of a building."
</P>
<P>
Michael Acker, another Dartmouth resident, said the new housing must keep seniors in mind. "As a senior who is aging quickly, I'm concerned that element of the plan is not getting the attention that it needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Acker said he would like to see a seniors' home and a new medical clinic in the community.
</P>
<P>
"What a great opportunity we have to work on this project to look at aging in place, housing for seniors to a long-term care facility and take that a step further," he said.

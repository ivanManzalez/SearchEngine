Halifax Regional Municipality's budget committee will consider a staff report recommending a 9.7 per cent increase to the average property tax bill when it meets for the first time on Tuesday to discuss the 2024-2025 budget.
</P>
<P>
This is the first stage of a months-long process before the actual budget is finalized, likely in April.
</P>
<P>
The report says, as in the previous year, the municipality is "forced to tackle ongoing inflation and continued population growth."
</P>
<P>
The tax hike is needed to cover a revenue shortfall of $68.7 million, the report says.
</P>
<P>
In its recommendations for the 2023-24 budget, staff proposed an eight per cent tax hike. That figure was eventually reduced to 5.9 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Coun. Cathy Deagle-Gammon, the vice-chair of the audit and finance standing committee, said the municipality is not allowed to have a deficit so there are only a few options available to it.
</P>
<P>
"We can do that by debt financing, we can do it by changing the tax rate and we can do it by cutting services," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the three options that are available to council and, as we move through this journey, those will be the things that will be looked at."
</P>
<P>
Residents not happy
</P>
<P>
Deagle-Gammon said she has already been hearing from residents saying that they are already being forced to cut back and an almost 10 per cent tax increase is too much.
</P>
<P>
She said council has to be "very, very conscious" of the impact budget decisions have on residents.
</P>
<P>
Coun. Pamela Lovelace said the original proposal in the current staff report was for a 15 per cent increase but it was brought down to 9.7 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Lovelace said she anticipates some long and difficult debates as council works to finalize a budget.
</P>
<P>
"I will be asking departments to consolidate to ensure that they're streamlining their services and ... working as hard as we can to ... decrease it as much as we can."
</P>
<P>
Businesses still recovering
</P>
<P>
In addition to the burden such a large increase would place on homeowners and new renters, Lovelace said many businesses are still struggling to recover from COVID-19 and wildfires.
</P>
<P>
Lovelace said she does not think the 9.7 per cent increase is acceptable but she recognizes that the municipality is struggling to deal with deficiencies in a number of areas, including road infrastructure and transit.
</P>
<P>
She said the municipality is heading in a direction where it is becoming less and less affordable.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Russell, executive director of the Investment Property Owners Association of Nova Scotia, said the suggested tax increase would be devastating for the apartment rental industry and would cause a decrease of investment in rental properties.
</P>
<P>
Russell said most people living in the city would want to see a reduction in the size of the municipal government until the economy stabilizes.

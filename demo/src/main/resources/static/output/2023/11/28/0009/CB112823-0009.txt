Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr also approved bylaw and zoning changes needed to support the development agreements.

The province says the projects are consistent with Halifax's regional plan, which outlines the municipality's planning policies.

"We all know about the urgent need for housing right now. We're a growing a municipality. For example, we've added about 30,000 people to HRM this year. At the rate we're growing, we know that our need for housing has never been greater," Halifax CAO Cathie O'Toole said of the housing developments.

O'Toole says under the housing accelerator fund, the municipality is receiving federal funding to hire 29 more employees for the planning and developing group. This means they should have enough staff to handle the new developments, she said.

<P>
Any updates on these projects and others will be posted on the municipality's website.

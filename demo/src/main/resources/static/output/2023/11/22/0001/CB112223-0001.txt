7% tax hike on table as Edmonton city council begins 2024 budget debate; 
</P>
<P>
More money needed for police, encampment cleanup, inflation pressure, city says
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Property owners in Edmonton face a 7.09 per cent tax increase for 2024 as the city says it's trying to manage inflation, a growing population and the maintenance and enhancement of core services. 
</P>
<P>
Budget deliberations started Tuesday at city hall, where council will discuss the need for the hike, which is up from the nearly five per cent they approved last year.
</P>
<P>
Andre Corbould, the city manager, outlined the reasons for the adjustments, including inflation, utilities, an increase in police salaries and parks and roads services. 
</P>
<P>
He said administration recognizes that it's a difficult request. 
</P>
<P>
"We also know that when we ask for funds from Edmontonians, we need to be clear about how they're spent." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the proposed increase would go toward filling a nearly $44-million funding gap for police, including $19.7 million in salary increases agreed on in an arbitrated settlement earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Another $11.8 million is approved in the police funding formula alongside $2.9 million for the healthy streets community hub in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Police take up the biggest portion of the city's operating budget at 15.2 per cent, followed by transit at 12.5.
</P>
<P>
Council is scheduled to discuss and vote on the budget adjustments by Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
If the change is approved, Edmonton homeowners will pay about $750 in property taxes for every $100,000 of their home's assessed value in 2024.
</P>
<P>
Homeowners paid $701 in taxes for every $100,000 of assessed value this year. 
</P>
<P>
'Tough choices'
</P>
<P>
Mayor Amarjeet Sohi said it's important to invest in public safety and transit while trying to keep taxes as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I hear from Edmontonians that they're struggling, where their day-to-day expenses, they're making some tough choices and we will have to make some tough choices." 
</P>
<P>
Before budget deliberations began, the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce sent a release to media, expressing worry that some local businesses wouldn't survive a seven per cent increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's daunting," Doug Griffiths, CEO of the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, said of businesses trying to recover from the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Now to see only the second year into this four-year budget cycle, that proposed 7.09 per cent increase on property taxes is coming is very disconcerting."
</P>
<P>
City managers are also requesting $13.8 million to pay for staff, peace officers and cleaning crews to respond to encampments and increase access to bridge housing spaces plus two hygiene hubs for unhoused people. 
</P>
<P>
More funding asks
</P>
<P>
Some groups are asking for more money.
</P>
<P>
Erick Ambtman, executive director of End Poverty Edmonton, wants the city to invest $180,000 to train staff for an early learning and care plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said he's frustrated that the conversation is focused on property taxes instead of improving life in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to talk about what kind of city I want and I understand that it's going to cost money to have that city," Ambtman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the audacity to say we're going to try to end poverty. I want to be a part of that, I want to be a part of that community." 
</P>
<P>
Explore Edmonton is asking for $10.3 million to continue growing the economy and broadening the mandate to attract events and bids. 
</P>
<P>
"We leverage the dollars that you put in," CEO Traci Bednard said.
</P>
<P>
"When you provide $1 we've been able to generate another $6 just for the bid and the economic impact of those of course is far greater to the businesses that support tourism in our city."
</P>
<P>
Last year, council also agreed to find $60 million a year in savings or cuts to services and programs that don't affect core services like snow removal and transit.

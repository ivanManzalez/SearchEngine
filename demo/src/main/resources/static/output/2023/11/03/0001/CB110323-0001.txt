Methodology
</P>
<P>
CBC News consulted with Alan Marshall, a finance instructor at York University's Schulich School of Business, for the calculations. The exact formula used can be found here.
</P>
<P>
The calculations only apply to fixed-rate mortgages in Canada, which requires fixed-rate mortgages to be compounded semi-annually by law.

The results presented here are estimates and might be different from other mortgage calculators.

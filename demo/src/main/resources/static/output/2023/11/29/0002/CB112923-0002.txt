An equipment failure killed 100,000 Atlantic salmon worth $5 million at the Sustainable Blue land-based salmon farm in Nova Scotia earlier this month, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A filter that removes carbon dioxide from holding tanks experienced a "structural collapse" on Nov. 4, the company told CBC News.
</P>
<P>
The land-based salmon farm is the only one in North America with zero waste discharge thanks to its proprietary water filtration system which constantly recirculates water on-site.
</P>
<P>
The fish kill has left the company unable to supply customers until June 2024.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely a setback. But we will get back on our feet. We will find the cause of the incident," says CEO Kirk Havercroft.
</P>
<P>
Why the carbon dioxide stripper malfunctioned is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
It happened in the newest production building at the Sustainable Blue complex at Centre Burlington in Hants County near the Minas Basin.
</P>
<P>
Unable to supply customers for seven months
</P>
<P>
Fish inside five other buildings were unaffected but the malfunction killed off 20 per cent of production. The salmon were market ready, weighing between four and eight kilograms each.
</P>
<P>
The company will be unable to supply customers until smaller fish grow.
</P>
<P>
"The building did contain the largest fish that we had and that's the reason why unfortunately now there'll be a production interruption for approximately seven months," Havercroft said.
</P>
<P>
The failed equipment eliminates carbon dioxide that fish release in the water and is a key part of the filtration system at the facility which produces 1,000 metric tonnes per year.
</P>
<P>
The CO2 stripper is unique to Sustainable Blue.
</P>
<P>
Havercroft said the "structural collapse" was a construction failure and not an issue of technology performance.
</P>
<P>
The affected holding tanks were in a building completed in April 2022.
</P>
<P>
Havercroft said the building's performance until the failure "had been exemplary and has comfortably reached operating design parameters with zero waste discharge."
</P>
<P>
'Isolated incident'
</P>
<P>
"We think this is an isolated incident," Havecroft said.
</P>
<P>
"Our early indications are that it should be perfectly feasible to identify the cause of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"And we fully expect to be in a position of being able to repair it and bring everything back online by early March," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company has insurance but it's not clear what it will or will not cover.
</P>
<P>
Havercroft says its land-based salmon farm is viable and will recover from this setback.
</P>
<P>
"We all believe in this project. We believe that land-based salmon aquaculture will be important not just to Nova Scotia, but to the whole of North America. Our intention is to recover, move forward and implement a solution which means this incident hopefully never happens again."
</P>
<P>
Federal government backing
</P>
<P>
The federal government has been an early and sustaining backer of the company.
</P>
<P>
Records from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency show about $3.5 million in funding to Sustainable Fish Farming Ltd., its registered corporate name, since 2006.
</P>
<P>
Most recently on Oct. 10 — less than a month before the fish kill — ACOA announced it provided $505,000 "to purchase advanced automated salmon processing equipment to increase efficiency, product quality, explore new markets and develop new value-added products by processing fish normally sent to the waste stream."

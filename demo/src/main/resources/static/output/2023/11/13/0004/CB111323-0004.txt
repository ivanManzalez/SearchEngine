Who's running to be U.S. president in 2024?; 
</P>
<P>
Multiple Democrats and Republicans are vying for their party's nomination
</P>

<P>
The field of candidates seeking to be the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election got smaller late Sunday with the withdrawal of Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Scott made his surprise announcement on Fox News Channel's Sunday Night in America, catching donors and even his campaign staff by surprise.
</P>
<P>
"I love America more today than I did on May 22," Scott said Sunday. "But when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign. I think the voters who are the most remarkable people on the planet have been really clear that they're telling me, 'Not now, Tim."'
</P>
<P>
Scott's exit from the race to be the party's nominee comes just two months before the start of voting in Iowa's leadoff Republican caucuses.
</P>
<P>
The Republican race saw the withdrawal of Mike Pence, Donald Trump's former vice-president, on Oct. 28. Pence had been polling behind Scott and facing fundraising issues.
</P>
<P>
Two days before Pence pulled out, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder shut down his bid for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
Here are the remaining declared 2024 hopefuls from both parties:
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party
</P>
<P>
Doug Burgum 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota's governor, Doug Burgum, joined the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 6, making his announcement in the Wall Street Journal. A long-shot candidate known to few outside his home state, Burgum, 66, is a former computer software entrepreneur. In a video previewing his announcement, he portrayed himself as a rural state conservative, experienced in energy policy and far outside of the war of words that's been going on between Trump and DeSantis.
</P>
<P>
Chris Christie
</P>
<P>
The former New Jersey governor formally launched his bid for the Republican nomination for president June 6. Christie has cast himself as the only candidate in the field willing to directly take on Trump. It's Christie's second try for the nomination, after losing to Trump in 2016 and going on to become a close adviser of his before breaking with the former president over his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election.
</P>
<P>
Ron DeSantis
</P>
<P>
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis launched his presidential campaign bid in a highly anticipated live audio chat with Elon Musk on Twitter. But the event was plagued by technical problems, prompting mockery from his rivals and casting doubt about his viability as a candidate with enough support to defeat Trump, his one-time ally. His campaign said he raised $1 million within an hour of his presidential announcement, and $8.2 million in the 24 hours after his campaign launch.
</P>
<P>
Nikki Haley
</P>
<P>
A former governor of South Carolina and Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Haley, 51, has emphasized her relative youth compared with Biden and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of two Indian immigrants. She has gained a reputation in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who has pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
Asa Hutchinson 
</P>
<P>
The former Arkansas governor launched his bid for the White House in April with a call for Trump to step aside to deal with his indictment. Hutchinson, 72, has touted his experience leading the deeply conservative state as proof he can deliver on policies Republican voters care about, citing his record with tax cuts and job creation initiatives as particular sources of pride. Still, his name recognition remains limited outside Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Vivek Ramaswamy
</P>
<P>
A former biotechnology investor and executive, Ramaswamy, 37, launched a firm in 2022 to pressure companies to abandon environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. He announced in February he was running for the Republican nomination. The political outsider remains a long-shot candidate.
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump 
</P>
<P>
Trump announced his election campaign last November, even as he faced criticism from within his party over his support of candidates who performed badly in the 2022 midterms. He has been the front-runner ever since, with a firm grip on his base. The 76-year-old former president even increased his standing in polls after he was indicted in connection with an alleged hush-money payment to a porn star. At the same time, he remains unpopular with much of the U.S. electorate.  
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party
</P>
<P>
Joe Biden
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Joe Biden announced he would run again on April 25, four years to the day after he declared his 2020 candidacy. The 80-year-old Democrat, already the oldest U.S. president ever, confirmed his intentions in a video in which he declared it his job to defend American democracy.
</P>
<P>
Marianne Williamson
</P>
<P>
The best-selling author and self-help guru launched her second, long-shot bid for the White House on March 23. She ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out of the race before any votes had been cast. 
</P>
<P>
Independent
</P>
<P>
Robert Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
An anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 69, abandoned his run as a Democrat to become an Independent candidate Oct. 9, saying he wants to make a "new Declaration of Independence" — from corporations, from the media and from the two major political parties.
</P>
<P>
"I've come here today to declare our independence from the tyranny of corruption which robs us of affordable lives, our belief in the future, and our respect for each other," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime environmentalist and son of former U.S. senator and attorney general Robert F. Kennedy has been known in recent years for his anti-vaccine activism. His announcement saw some of his siblings release a statement to "denounce his candidacy" as "perilous for our country."
</P>
<P>
Dropped out: Francis Suarez (R), Will Hurd (R), Larry Elder (R), Mike Pence (R), Tim Scott (R).

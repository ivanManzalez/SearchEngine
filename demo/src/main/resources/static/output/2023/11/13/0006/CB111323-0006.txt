Engine failure sends Canadian Coast Guard ship into early refit; 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first mechanical issue to sideline a Nova Scotia-based mid-shore patrol ship

A Canadian Coast Guard ship on patrol in the Bay of Fundy experienced an emergency engine shutdown last month that has forced it out of service.
</P>
<P>
The mid-shore fishery patrol vessel CCGS Corporal Teather C.V. was carrying out enforcement activities for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in the Minas Basin on Oct. 23 when a cylinder lining failed on the starboard main engine.
</P>
<P>
The cylinder lining is the inner wall where the piston moves up and down. It is designed to provide a smooth and durable surface for the piston to create a proper seal, needed to efficiently power the crankshaft.
</P>
<P>
The good news, if there is any, is the breakdown happened just before the vessel was due to enter a scheduled refit.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries and Oceans spokesperson Debra Buott-Matheson said the failure resulted in the engine coolant and some metal shavings being released into a container under the engine that collects oil used to lubricate engine parts.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the failure is unknown at this time; however, work is ongoing to determine the cause. The repair options and plan are under development," Buott-Matheson said in a statement confirming the incident.
</P>
<P>
Out of service early 
</P>
<P>
CCGS Corporal Teather came out of service five days earlier than planned because of the failure. CCGS Private Robertson, another mid-shore patrol vessel based in Dartmouth, N.S., was assigned to carry out patrols.
</P>
<P>
"The return to service date for Teather and a cost estimate for the repair are unknown at this time," Buott-Matheson said.
</P>
<P>
The refit was supposed to run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 12, but the cylinder failure may change that.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first mechanical issue to sideline a Nova Scotia based mid-shore patrol ship.
</P>
<P>
CCGS Peddle was immobilized for most of the last three years by refits, mishaps, part failures and supply chain delays after one of its two engines failed in 2020.

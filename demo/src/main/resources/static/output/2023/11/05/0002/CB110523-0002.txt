Why a Nova Scotia author hired sensitivity readers for her debut novel about a trans woman;

A Nova Scotia author who has adapted her film about a young transgender woman finding acceptance in her rural hometown says using sensitivity readers opened her eyes to a better version of the story.
</P>
<P>
Shelley Thompson used three sensitivity readers during the editing process of her novel, Roar, which is based on the screenplay of her 2021 film Dawn, Her Dad and The Tractor.
</P>
<P>
Sensitivity readers are specialized editors who look through authors' work for potentially offensive material or stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
The book follows Dawn, who returns to her rural Nova Scotia home after the death of her mother, with the hope of mending her relationship with her estranged father.
</P>
<P>
Thompson wrote the film, and now novel, by drawing on her son's experience of being transgender, but also included her own perspective as the parent of a transgender child.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a trans person and I can't speak for trans individuals," Thompson told CBC Radio's Mainstreet Halifax. "There's so many elements of the trans journey I can't even imagine — and I have a good imagination — but I can't."
</P>
<P>
Thompson said she hired sensitivity readers to ensure she captured the realistic experience of being trans, beyond her own parental perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Merryfield, who runs the Cape Breton Transgender Network, was one of the sensitivity readers for the book.
</P>
<P>
She said it's critical for authors to employ sensitivity readers if they're telling a story about another community's experience.
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting process for me to just sit and read a book with the notion of I am looking for issues here for potential readers in the future, to help Shelley create that story," Merryfield told Mainstreet.
</P>
<P>
"And I came away at the end of it just blown away with the way that Shelley had captured in the nuance of what I knew she had experienced and some of what she hadn't experienced."
</P>
<P>
Merryfield is a trans woman, and has been a support person for trans children, their families and trans adults for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
She said this is the first time she has been asked to be a sensitivity reader. She said she focused on the development of the characters, and the nuance of the trans journey.
</P>
<P>
"It's worth stating [that] for trans people, the journey they take is often a very solitary one until the point that they come out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And at the point they come out and tell others, it becomes a bit of a shock for others, but it's not a shock for them because they've been dealing with it for so long."
</P>
<P>
Working with sensitivity readers
</P>
<P>
Thompson said there has been some resistance about using sensitivity readers in the industry because some authors think it limits what they can write about.
</P>
<P>
But she thought it was necessary for this story, comparing it to hiring an expert if you were writing a book from the perspective of a police officer or doctor.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't get the right information, you just look foolish," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's not about how you look, but you're also putting out wrong information and basing stories on wrong information and I think that's not good."
</P>
<P>
After the sensitivity readers went through the manuscript, Thompson said they had discussions about certain characters and scenes to decide if they needed to be altered to better reflect real-life experiences.
</P>
<P>
"What I found so extraordinary was none of the notes that I got were no-go areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
"And the slight changes that I had to make, what I found about a sensitivity reader was it opened my eyes to certain things, but it made me be creative to offer a better version of a thought that we could both agree on."
</P>
<P>
One example of this was a scene where Dawn's father, John Andrew, meets a friend of his daughter's who is a tall, transgender Black woman.
</P>
<P>
"John Andrew is looking at a person the same height of himself, which is very rare for him to encounter a woman of that height, and so he has to go, 'Whoa, I'm looking at a woman, a beautiful Black woman, whose hands are as big as mine, who's as tall as me, and I have to adjust my thinking to allow the space for that individual to bring all those attributes to the table," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
Merryfield said she has concerns about that scene because there are certain binary assumptions around height.
</P>
<P>
"If you're of a certain height, you must be male. If you're below a certain height, you must be female, and that happens a lot around the misgendering of trans individuals," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that scene is told from John Andrew's perspective, so his reaction is meant to reflect someone who is still learning.
</P>
<P>
She said working with sensitivity readers has taught her to be a better ally, and she hopes the book will encourage others to learn more about the trans experience.
</P>
<P>
"We're losing a whole generation of kids — potentially a whole generation of potential intelligence, capability, skills, talent — by shutting them down," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
"We're losing people all around the world in many different ways, but we don't need to lose them in Canada. We don't need to lose them in the [United] States by saying we don't need you, you're invisible. We don't need to do that.
</P>
<P>
"So I want to be part of the groundswell that helps make sure those kids are safe to fulfil who they are."

Roar was released by Nimbus Publishing on Oct. 31.

Finland closing its border with Russia amid alleged 'hybrid attack' using migrants; 
</P>
<P>
Crossings to be shut for at least 2 weeks following surge of migrants trying to enter from Russia
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Finland is temporarily shutting down its 1,340-kilometre long eastern border with Russia after seeing an abnormally large number of migrants arrive this month — a situation its prime minister describes as a "hybrid attack" orchestrated by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish officials have accused Russia of guiding third-country migrants to its border crossings to manufacture a crisis, as a possible retaliation for joining NATO earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept any attempts to undermine our national security," Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said Tuesday at a news conference in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has denied the allegation and Finland's move may not be acceptable under international law.
</P>
<P>
Here's what is happening at Finland's border with Russia — and why it's a concern. 
</P>
<P>
What has been happening?
</P>
<P>
The Raja-Jooseppi checkpoint is Finland's northernmost border crossing with Russia and the only one that remained open until this week. Seven others have been closed since Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Migrants arriving there do so in frigid Arctic weather with less than three hours of daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Once it closes Wednesday night, the only way migrants will be able to seek protection in Finland will be via air and maritime points of entry.
</P>
<P>
The government says the entire border with Russia will remain closed until at least Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, more than 800 asylum seekers — mainly from countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia — have arrived at Finland's border crossings in November alone. There were only 100 between August and November.
</P>
<P>
Orpo said shuttering those border crossings is "a necessary and proportionate measure" and that border authorities warn the situation may "intensify even more" otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move," Orpo said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Is Finland the only country concerned?
</P>
<P>
Estonia, also a NATO member, made a similar claim last week when Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur described an influx of migrants as a "fully state-orchestrated" operation by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the border crossing in the city of Narva, linked by bridge with Ivangorod in Russia, recorded 30 arrivals over the course of a few days, all of which were sent back, according to Estonia's public broadcaster ERR. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia says it has been preparing for such a situation for some time, having seen a similar tactic play out with Russia's staunch ally Belarus, which has put similar pressures on its neighbours Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The situation along Finland's border gave Estonia further cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
"All these hundreds of migrants are ending up in one border crossing point in Finland with bicycles during the wintertime," Pevkur said at a news conference in Stockholm last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, seriously?"
</P>
<P>
Syrian asylum seekers told Finnish public broadcaster YLE that Russian authorities had facilitated their crossings — including forcing them to pay for bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Norway, on the other hand, a neighbour of both Finland and Russia, says it has experienced no irregularities on its border.  
</P>
<P>
Why is this considered a threat? 
</P>
<P>
Migration pressure is seen as a threat because it risks pushing democracies to abandon some of their commitment to provide asylum, thereby exposing the fragility of democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been under heavy migration pressure for years, triggering a backlash in many places against migrants that has also strengthened far-right political parties.
</P>
<P>
In Poland, the border crisis that has been blamed on Belarus deepened pre-existing social divisions, pitting those seeking a tough stance on migration against those favouring a more accepting approach. 
</P>
<P>
The government, at the time, accused those of siding with migrants as unwittingly helping hostile foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
How is Russia responding? 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has denied doing anything nefarious at its border with Finland and called claims it's weaponizing migrants "completely baseless." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, following the initial rise in border closings, Russian media reported presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Russia "has never in its recent history threatened Finland." 
</P>
<P>
He said the situation was disappointing and that the country's long-standing relationship with Finland has "been replaced by an entirely Rusophobic position."
</P>
<P>
In April, the Kremlin called Finland's accession to NATO a dangerous mistake and cautioned it would be forced to take "counter-measures" in response.
</P>
<P>
Can Finland do this? 
</P>
<P>
The Finnish government insists it is within its rights to take such a drastic step to secure its borders, but UN agencies suggest that may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
A "complete closure" of a border that bars asylum seekers "would be contrary to international law and to the principle of non-refoulement," according to a recent post on the matter by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Nordic and Baltic countries. 
</P>
<P>
That principle is a binding obligation "not to remove any person to a country where [they] would face torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or other irreparable harm."
</P>
<P>
It can apply to deportation or expulsion and to "non-admission at the border," the UNHCR said.

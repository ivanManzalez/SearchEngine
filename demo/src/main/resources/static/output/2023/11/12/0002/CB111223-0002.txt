Sobriety advocates weigh ups and downs of Tim Hortons' new Baileys-flavoured drinks; 
</P>
<P>
Beverages are non-alcoholic but may be triggering for some newly sober people, one says

Tim Hortons has announced it's introducing non-alcoholic menu items flavoured with Irish cream liqueur, which is drawing mixed reaction from people who help treat alcoholism and encourage sobriety.
</P>
<P>
The international coffee chain says it will be offering Baileys-flavoured coffee drinks and a Baileys-flavoured Boston cream doughnut for a limited time this season.
</P>
<P>
Lee-Anne Richardson, who runs the Halifax-based peer support group, Sober City, says she's been hearing a generally positive reaction from people who are working to stay sober, but some are concerned.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who has been sober since 2014, said being reminded of alcoholic beverages, whether by logos, advertisements or other people drinking, can weigh heavily on people who have just quit drinking.
</P>
<P>
"It can start to be triggering and start to be like, 'Oh, well, I remember what that was like,' and [they] sort of think down along that path," Richardson told CBC Radio's Information Morning Halifax.
</P>
<P>
"So for a lot of people, in the very beginning, it can be really hard to be seeing these reminders everywhere."
</P>
<P>
She said coffee shops, like Tim Hortons, are often considered safe places for people who are sober, as a place they can go to meet their sponsor or peer support. That may no longer be the case, she said.
</P>
<P>
"To have the possibility of being triggered in the — quote, unquote — safe space can be pretty scary for some people," she said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said she's also heard some say the non-alcoholic drinks are "adding to our alcohol-obsessed culture."
</P>
<P>
Heather Allen, the chief communications officer for the Canadian Alcohol Use Disorder Society, agrees that promoting alcohol everywhere may not be the right approach, but she appreciates non-alcoholic options.
</P>
<P>
"There is a movement for non-alcoholic beverages and making that a part of a culture shift to people being able to enjoy drinks, enjoy socializing, in a way that helps them not have to have alcohol in it, but still feel that they're having fun," Allen said.
</P>
<P>
"So I can understand that there might be some concerns for people who are struggling with cravings, but as part of a larger cultural shift of trying to rethink our drinking, I don't see it as really a bad thing."
</P>
<P>
Allen said there are also treatments available for alcohol cravings, including medication and counselling, that can help people working to stay sober.
</P>
<P>
"It's not some sort of moral failing and people have to white knuckle and avoid anything that says alcohol on it ... this is a health condition and that there's lots of different ways to get your cravings under control so you can fully partake in society," she said.
</P>
<P>
Can help people stay sober
</P>
<P>
Richardson said while some people avoid all alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks entirely — out of concern of relapsing — it can have the opposite effect for others.
</P>
<P>
She said some people who are sober might miss the taste of a particular drink, like Baileys, or miss having a special beverage.
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily the getting drunk part. You missed the routine of making a fancy drink — it's like a little present for yourself," she said.
</P>
<P>
So if you have a non-alcoholic product, you can still do that little present for yourself, you just don't have the effects of alcohol, so that can help people stay sober as well."
</P>
<P>
But Richardson's main concern is that children will be able to consume the Baileys-flavoured items. She called it another way for them "to make an early association with alcohol."
</P>
<P>
"That bothers me because it's everywhere, in almost everything, and it's already ingrained in our society that you drink when you're stressed ... when we're celebrating or when we're socializing,"
</P>
<P>
"So to add in another element of, 'Hey, here's this alcohol,' even though it's not alcohol — it's the programming that's happening so since there's no control around what can be purchased at places like Tim Hortons, we just leave it up to the discretion of the parents."
</P>
<P>
CBC News contacted Tim Hortons for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication.

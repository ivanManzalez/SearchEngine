Hot and humid weather blanketed Toronto Tuesday and is expected to hang around until Thursday, Environment Canada says.
</P>
<P>
The federal weather agency has issued a heat warning for much of southern Ontario, forecasting daytime temperatures into the low 30s with humidex values soaring into the 40s. Night time temperatures will likely hover in the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
"There will be very little relief from the heat overnight," said Katrina Eyk, a senior meteorologist at Environment Canada.
</P>
<P>
Heat warnings are posted when conditions are expected to pose a risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
The hot conditions may lead to the deterioration of air quality, Environment Canada says, which means the Air Quality Health Index could reach the "high risk" category at various points.
</P>
<P>
A cold front is expected to roll into the GTA on Thursday night, bringing relief from the heat by Friday morning, Eyk says.
</P>
<P>
For now, the weather agency says it's important to drink plenty of water before you feel thirsty and stay in a cool place if possible. If you need to be outside, be sure to take regularly scheduled breaks in a cool area. 
</P>
<P>
Rafi Aaron, a spokesperson for Interfaith Coalition to Fight Homelessness, said the current heat wave impacts Toronto's homeless population more than other groups in the city, calling it an "emergency situation."
</P>
<P>
"It is just not a matter anymore of having cooling centres in the summer and warming centres in the winter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 days, when twice Toronto had the worst air quality in the world, people were told not to be outdoors. But if you're unhoused, you have to be outdoors."
</P>
<P>
Some city pools to stay open late
</P>
<P>
In response to the heat warning, the city announced it will be extending hours at some of its outdoor pools until 11:45 p.m. Tuesday. Toronto officially opened its outdoor pools and 90 supervised wading pools last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Residents can take a late swim at these seven city pools: 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor pools will be open daily until Sunday, Sept. 3, at 4 p.m., except for 10 that will continue to be open until Monday, Sept. 4, at 5 p.m. Most of the city's outdoor pools are open daily from noon to about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city said people heading out to swim should check hours for specific pools here.
</P>
<P>
The city's more than 140 splash and spray pads will be open until Sunday, Sept. 17. Splash pads are open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and are activated by a push button. 
</P>
<P>
The city said lifeguards are supervising 10 city beaches seven days a week from 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Beach-goers are reminded to swim in designated areas only.

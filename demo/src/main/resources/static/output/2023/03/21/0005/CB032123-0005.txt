A tax clinic in Souls Harbour Rescue Mission in Halifax is helping dozens of low-income and vulnerable Canadians file their tax returns for free this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Returning Hope Program is an initiative by H&R Block that's in its seventh year and runs until Saturday. It is aimed at helping people who struggle to file taxes due to a lack of resources such as a bank account, government ID or a computer.

Cherry Laxton, the chief operating officer at Souls Harbour, said the clinic has seen an "exponential" growth over the years and has served hundreds of clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we see a growth in the number of clients who are coming in," said Laxton.
</P>
<P>
She said if it wasn't for this service, some people wouldn't be able to file their taxes. That's a big problem because many people who come to Souls Harbour rely on disability benefits or income assistance. If they don't file their taxes, they won't receive those government benefits.
</P>
<P>
Laxton says holding the tax clinic in Souls Harbour creates a comfortable environment for clients who regularly use the space. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are coming here anyway to access meals or clothing from our free mart location."
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them just wouldn't go to a place where they're not familiar or if they would have to use any of their disposable income to access the service."
</P>
<P>
Craig Putt regularly comes to Soul Harbour to eat. On Monday he was there to file his taxes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm blind. I can't see, do nothing, can't do it myself right," said Putt. "That's why I come in for help."
</P>
<P>
The clinic at the Souls Harbour location on Cunard Street is by appointment only.

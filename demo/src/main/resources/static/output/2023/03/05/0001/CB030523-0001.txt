B.C. government review into providing ACs during heat wave still incomplete — 3 months past its deadline; 
</P>

Ministry spokesperson says government finalizing report, needs 'thorough analysis'

<P>
The B.C. government has missed the deadline for its review into the possibility of providing air conditioners during heat waves as recommended by a coroners' death review panel last year.
</P>
<P>
The panel was convened to look into the deadly 2021 heat dome in the province where 619 people died in one week amid record high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
In its June 2022 report, the panel recommended the Ministry of Health — together with the Ministry of Poverty Reduction — complete a review into providing air conditioners as medical devices through existing programs in the province, like the medical equipment provision program (MEPP), during extreme heat events.
</P>
<P>
The government was expected to complete their review after consulting with "vulnerable populations" and make their findings public by Dec. 1, 2022.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than three months later, medical and policy experts are questioning why it's taking B.C. so long to approve the potentially life-saving policy, given the increasing likelihood of future deadly heat waves and the number of people with disabilities living without access to cooling devices.
</P>
<P>
 
</P>
<P>
"Air conditioners are a key strategy for saving people's lives and keeping them well during heat events," said Dr. Jennifer Baumbusch, a professor at the University of British Columbia's school of nursing, who works with older adults.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people who died during the heat dome were older adults, many were women, many were disabled, and many were also poor."
</P>
<P>
 
</P>
<P>
Baumbusch says air conditioners are particularly relevant in B.C., after the panel found that many people died in smaller apartments without appropriate ventilation.
</P>
<P>
"One of the challenges is for people to be able to have that amount of money upfront to pay for the air conditioner," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we already have a comprehensive system in our province for people to be able to get medical equipment, without having to pay out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
"Adding air conditioners to that list would mean working with vendors to ensure that people, in a similar way to which they get their wheelchairs or walkers … they could be adding air conditioners."
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Health Ministry said the government "had undertaken" an internal policy review for providing cooling devices as medical equipment, and that it was being finalized.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is ensuring that a thorough analysis and appropriate engagement is done before finalizing the report," the spokesperson added, when asked why the government had missed the Dec. 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson also mentioned the ministry reached out to other arms of the government — Pharmacare, the MEPP and Fraser Health — during the review, and that a consultation process with vulnerable people was still ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson did not specify when the review would be released.
</P>
<P>
Policy analyst questions speed of response
</P>
<P>
The government said it had looked at programs like the income tax rebate as a potential funding source for cooling devices, as well as other jurisdictions — like Ontario — that already have programs providing cooling devices to people who can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
Gabrielle Peters, a disabled writer and policy analyst who co-wrote a memo in 2021 recommending Vancouver make cooling devices available as medical equipment, criticized the province for how long it was taking to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
"After the heat dome happened in Oregon … by the next summer, they had air conditioning distribution programs for poor people," she told CBC News.
</P>
<P>
"Poor people didn't decide to put themselves in housing that's poor quality, that's very hot," added Peters, who resigned from the coroners' death panel because of what she described as a lack of urgency.
</P>
<P>
"The only intervention they [the B.C. government] have to offer you is by giving you an alert on your phone.
</P>
<P>
"They have been indifferent to the poverty and suffering of disabled people."
</P>
<P>
Peters argues policymakers need to apply philosopher Martha Fineman's "vulnerability theory", which suggests that vulnerability is a universal phenomenon, and that social institutions either provide or fail to provide people with resilience.
</P>
<P>
"The climate-change challenges provide perhaps a particularly apt illustration of what Fineman's universal vulnerability approach, which she contrasts with individual rights-based approaches to promote justice, has to offer," Peters wrote in a paper analyzing the issue.

RCMP in Nova Scotia are appealing for the public's help in a voyeurism investigation.
</P>
<P>
Police were called to a café on Highway 224 in Middle Musquodoboit, N.S., early Friday afternoon for a report of a man peering through a vent at a youth using the washroom.
</P>
<P>
RCMP Cpl. Guillaume Tremblay said officers spoke to the youth and a witness who led them to a suspect who was arrested later that same afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe there could be other victims out there," Tremblay said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said police are seeking additional information and are asking any other victims to come forward and contact their local police.
</P>
<P>
Tremblay said officers searched the café but could find no recording device or surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
The suspect has been released on conditions and is scheduled to appear in Nova Scotia provincial court next month.

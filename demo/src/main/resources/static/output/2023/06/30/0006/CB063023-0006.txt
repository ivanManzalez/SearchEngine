Meet Tyler Peddle — the only Nova Scotian drafted into the NHL this year; 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Peddle of Antigonish was taken by the Columbus Blue Jackets with the final pick in the draft

It was a long wait for Tyler Peddle, but it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by 12 family members in the stands at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Peddle had to wait for 223 players to have their names called.
</P>
<P>
While many would have lost hope near the end of Thursday's rounds, the 18-year-old from Antigonish, N.S., said he had a gut feeling he should stick around. Finally, the Columbus Blue Jackets called him as the 224th and final pick.
</P>
<P>
"I kind of blacked out," Peddle said Saturday. "Like, all I heard was Quebec Major Junior and then my club team, Drummondville. I didn't even hear my name. I just heard my family, like, started screaming.
</P>
<P>
"And so I figured that was probably me if they were screaming. So, no, it was crazy. I mean, it was a blur. But it's a moment I'm never going to forget for the rest of my life."
</P>
<P>
Peddle grew up playing for the Antigonish Bulldogs, where his father Brad — who is the head coach of the St. FX X-Men hockey team — helped him develop as a player.
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the reasons why I'm where I am today," Tyler Peddle said.
</P>
<P>
'I'm going to prove myself'
</P>
<P>
Peddle plays centre and left wing for the Drummondville Voltigeurs in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
He'll return to the Voltigeurs for training camp in August, but first he'll join the Blue Jackets for a development camp in Ohio starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to prove myself, I feel like that's pretty important," he said. "I'm ready and I'm more motivated than ever."
</P>
<P>
He wants other young players in Nova Scotia with big hockey ambitions to "keep the dream alive."
</P>
<P>
"You can be as talented as you want," he said. "But I think work ethic — that's the reason I got where I am right now. That's a pretty important thing to me. Keep believing."
</P>

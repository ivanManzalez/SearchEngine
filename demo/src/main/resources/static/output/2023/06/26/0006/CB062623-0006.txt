Doctors Nova Scotia says it has reached tentative agreements with the Department of Health and Wellness on new four-year contracts for 3,400 doctors in the province.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the organization said contracts were presented to Nova Scotia's physicians for ratification on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached the best deals possible for Nova Scotia's doctors — while also ensuring the best care for the people of Nova Scotia," Dr. Colin Audain, president of Doctors Nova Scotia, said in the release.
</P>
<P>
"These contracts, if ratified, will help stabilize some of the most critical services in our province."
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreements were reached after five months at the negotiations table.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, the association's board of directors reviewed the details of the contracts and recommended they be presented to physicians for ratification.
</P>
<P>
Doctors will vote between July 7 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the contracts will be released after the agreements are ratified, and the results will be announced on July 20.
</P>
<P>
If ratified, the four-year contracts will replace the two 2019 agreements, which expired on March 31.

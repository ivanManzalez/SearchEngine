<P>
Like many renters in Calgary, seniors are being hit hard by the rising costs and shortage of housing in the city — and agencies providing them with affordable options are struggling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
Silvera for Seniors, a non-profit affordable housing provider in Calgary, has seen demand for seniors housing skyrocket this year.
</P>
<P>
From January to May this year, Silvera received 2,696 requests for housing. That's a 124-per cent increase from 2022, when the provider received 1,204 inquiries in that same period.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 551 seniors on Silvera's waitlist, and growing.
</P>
<P>
"The waitlists are really alarming," said Silvera CEO Arlene Adamson.
</P>
<P>
"When you know you're the last call for someone who is needing housing and who can ill afford to be waiting on a waitlist, who is facing potentially living out their life at a hospital, that's unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
While the general population is affected by rising rents and low rental vacancies, Adamson says seniors are in a unique position: they're often on a fixed income, can't crash with friends, and with time, their needs grow and become more complex.
</P>
<P>
She says the shortage reaches beyond Silvera — across the board, whether it's independent or supportive living, there isn't enough affordable housing for seniors in the city.
</P>
<P>
And while it's an issue the sector has been facing for years, Adamson says recently it's gotten worse because costs are rising, while the city's population is both growing and aging.
</P>
<P>
It's a crisis, she says, and it won't go away unless more housing is built.
</P>
<P>
"I can't put this strongly enough: this is significant. The urgency is now. We need governments at all three levels to invest in Silvera, in all community housing, to make sure operators can serve the needs of their waitlists."
</P>
<P>
Jason Nixon, Alberta's minister of seniors, community and social services, said on the Calgary Eyeopener on Tuesday that the province is continuing to invest in affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
"We are rolling out $1 billion of investment over the next few years to build and maintain affordable and senior housing across the province. I will also point out there will be another $235 million of rental assistance on top of that," said Nixon.

The 'terrifying' search for a new home
</P>
<P>
Nick Gardner is one of hundreds of seniors on Silvera's waitlist.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Calgarian has lived in the same Sunnyside building for 20 years. He's also the caretaker — he manages all non-money related tenant issues on his landlord's behalf — and in turn, the rent for his two-bedroom unit is reduced to $700 a month.
</P>
<P>
But last month, he was informed that his landlord had sold the building.
</P>
<P>
He says right now, he still doesn't know if he'll be rehired as the caretaker or how much his rent will cost when the new owners take over on July 1. But he says he's expecting that price to double.
</P>
<P>
Including Silvera, Gardner says he's reached out to seven seniors housing agencies — most of which don't have space for him, charge rates he can't afford or have units too small to live in, he says.
</P>
<P>
"The task to find a place for a senior is daunting," said Gardner. "Many seniors … they don't have the mental faculty to be able to spend two or three months to be able to find a place that is suitable."
</P>
<P>
He calls his search for a new home "terrifying," and says he's worried about the future of the city.
</P>
<P>
"Housing is becoming critical and the government should do something," said Gardner.
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be more and more people bankrupting themselves to be able to find a place to live and a place to work here, and that's really sad."
</P>
<P>
He says whether he stays or moves, he'll be taking a big hit financially.
</P>
<P>
Back at Silvera, Adamson says seniors who are struggling should reach out, as there are some vacancies in supported living homes and the team can help them navigate their options.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people falling into depression, maybe not having food security in their own home … so call us."

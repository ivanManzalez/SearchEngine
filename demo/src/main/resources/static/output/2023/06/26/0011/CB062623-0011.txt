"It ebbs and flows during times when precious metals seem to be worth more money. We tend to see these kinds of thefts," Cpl. Chris Marshall told CBC News, adding that the value of goods stolen would be in the tens of thousands of dollars range.

In four of the thefts, witnesses saw a black pickup truck. The RCMP have released grainy photos of the truck and the person driving.

"If anybody does recognize the driver of the black pickup truck, obviously that's something that we would want to know," Marshall said.

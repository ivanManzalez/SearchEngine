Hospital administrative staff reject tentative agreement, but strike may be weeks away;

Union official says pay is still a sticking point

Around 5,000 Nova Scotia health-care workers have voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, but it may take more than a month before a strike date is set.
</P>
<P>
The workers are represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union and Unifor. The unions put out a joint statement on Monday saying 81.5 per cent of the workers had voted to rejected a tentative agreement with provincial government that was reached in April.
</P>
<P>
Voting on the agreement began on June 5 and ended late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Members voting to strike include clerks in all departments, equipment operators, administrative assistants, transcriptionists and health record technicians in hospitals province-wide, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The previous offer from the government "did not budge on monetary issues raised by the bargaining team," the release said.
</P>
<P>
NSGEU president Sandra Mullen said pay remains a sticking point in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lagging behind
</P>
<P>
Mullen said workers feel their pay has been lagging behind other bargaining units in the health-care sector.
</P>
<P>
"Our members feel less respected and regarded in their workplace," she said. "The monetary package in these inflationary times, they felt, just hasn't kept up."
</P>
<P>
The previous contract expired Oct. 31, 2020, Mullen said, and they've been working to reach a new one since Nov. 1, 2020.
</P>
<P>
Although members have approved a strike, Mullen said it may be up to five weeks before they can take any job action.
</P>
<P>
Provincial legislation requires that unions complete an essential services plan with employers prior to a strike.
</P>
<P>
According to Mullen, the NSGEU is working with the other unions in the "complicated process" of identifying which positions are essential before they can call a strike date.
</P>
<P>
"That is very difficult to achieve but we put forward what we feel is who should be essential," Mullen said.
</P>
<P>
"We fully staff a unit like the cancer unit ... often we compare to the Christmas schedule where they do with a bare minimum."
</P>
<P>
Committed to continuing negotiations
</P>
<P>
An email from Nova Scotia Health on Tuesday said the authority and IWK Health are committed to continuing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Since the initial meeting in October 2022, Nova Scotia Health, IWK Health and the Council of Health Care Unions have worked hard and were able to reach a tentative agreement, which was narrowly rejected in April 2023," the email said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the offer that was presented, and ratified by other health-care bargaining units, is fair to employees and taxpayers and in the best interests of patients and families."

More seniors on the brink of homelessness facing evictions and unaffordable rent, experts say;

Seniors on fixed income struggle relocating to a new place, CanAge says

In the past 15 years, Donna McCrae, 73, has been evicted from two different rental units because owners were either demolishing the property or selling it.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Woodstock, Ont., senior will be forced to move for a third time.  
</P>
<P>
But this time, it's in the midst of a housing and affordability crisis — all while she's living on a fixed monthly income of just over $1,800 through Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security.
</P>
<P>
McCrae's caregiver, Chris Willet, also has to move in with her on a full-time basis due to her severe health conditions. They've looked at 32 different places, all with monthly rents ranging between $1,500 and $2,000. With most options out of their budget, the pair fears they'll end up homeless.
</P>
<P>
"Every time we get a place, we get settled and everything's okay, but then boom, we have to move out and my rent goes up exponentially higher," said McCrae. "I'm having trouble finding apartments because they're too costly. There's no way to pay for that plus my other expenses."
</P>
<P>
McCrae pays $820 a month at the rental complex she currently lives in. Her landlord served her an N13 eviction notice in November, asking her to leave by Jan. 31 so the property could be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming up with first-and-last (month's rent) for a person that's 73 years old, you're not getting any break here. She still has bills to pay where she is, and my salary has to come out as well," said Willet. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no way that she can save to move into a place and pay for a truck to move her belongings, her animals. And her health is not all that good, either."
</P>
<P>
McCrae is among a growing number of seniors who are impacted by evictions in the form of renovations or demolitions — and struggling to afford housing across Canada, according to CanAge, a national seniors' advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
"Older people, particularly those with accessibility needs, are in a pinch like never before in the rental market," said Laura Tamblyn Watts, the CEO of CanAge.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing an increase in renovictions that may specifically hurt older people who have a harder time trying to relocate to a new place. There may be challenges for them to get transportation, connecting with existing services and service providers, but it also means that affordability is increasingly a challenge."

'Demovictions' becoming a chronic problem, says advocate
</P>
<P>
The evictions are taking a heavy toll on seniors' mental health and isolating them from their communities and services, Tamblyn Watts said.
</P>
<P>
"Many can't find a place they can afford so people are becoming homeless at a higher rate than we've ever seen. It's not just about the place that you live, it's the community and your guards against social isolation," Tamblyn Watts said.
</P>
<P>
"It's very confusing and upsetting for people. That emotional health piece can lead to significant issues like depression and even cognitive impairments."
</P>
<P>
The ordeal has been extremely stressful for McCrae, who said she can't sleep at night thinking about her future and where she will live. She is worried she'll have to give up her dog and cat because most places she's talked to don't allow pets.
</P>
<P>
"If I got one of those $1,500 places, I'd be left with nothing and I'd have to get rid of a lot of my things, like my furniture," she said. "My animals mean a lot to me, I've had [my dog] since she was a puppy and it's not fair to them to have to be uprooted."
</P>
<P>
The apartment's property manager, Julia Shadow, told CBC News in an email that they are trying to work with tenants to find alternative options. She said McCrae was told a year in advance that the property was sold and was given a four-month written notice.
</P>
<P>
McCrae's situation is considered a "demoviction," which is becoming more common as interest rates on mortgages rise, said Nawton Chiles of the London chapter of ACORN, a tenants' rights group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunately tenants who pay the price, and it's much more common than even a few years ago," he said. "It seems that for the foreseeable future, demovictions will be a chronic problem."
</P>
<P>
In London, ACORN wants to tighten the rules on renovictions by pushing for a bylaw that would place the burden of relocating tenants for the duration of the renovation on landlords. It would also allow tenants to move back into their units at the same rental rate. 
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to find a new home, McCrae and Willet are running out of options. As her health worsens, McCrae said she is unsure how much longer she can continue relocating.

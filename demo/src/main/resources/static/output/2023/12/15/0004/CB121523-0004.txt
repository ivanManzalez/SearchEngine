<P>
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has reached a funding deal with the City of Vancouver that could see more than 40,000 new homes built over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, attending an announcement with Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, Housing Minister Sean Fraser and others, says the deal will "fast-track" more than 3,200 new homes over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Fraser says the agreement will provide almost $115 million from the government's Housing Accelerator Fund to cut barriers to building housing.
</P>
<P>
A news release says the deal will allow for more high-density housing, speed up development processes, and put more housing near transit.
</P>
<P>
It says Vancouver will streamline rezoning and expand affordable rental programs, and the initiatives will "significantly improve the way housing is built" in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Sim says the deal is not a gesture, but a collective commitment to providing more housing.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition Conservatives saidÂ in a news release that Trudeau's Liberal government is "failing to build anywhere near enough homes."

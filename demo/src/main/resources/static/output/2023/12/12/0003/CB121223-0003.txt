Donald Trump's re-election prospects are now a Supreme Court issue; 
</P>
<P>
A speedy trial — and conviction — would change the race. The high court is being asked to prevent delays

<P>
One of the most consequential questions of the 2024 U.S. presidential election has now been turned over to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental issue being litigated involves whether former U.S. president Donald Trump will be brought to trial before Americans vote in the general election next November.
</P>
<P>
This was the essence of a historic court filing Monday, the latest step in an escalating cat-and-mouse contest between Trump and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Special counsel Jack Smith urged the high court to intervene pre-emptively and decide on the merits of a Trump complaint that could delay a key case. Without immediate action, Smith said, the dispute could drag into the next Supreme Court term, and remain unresolved before the election.
</P>
<P>
It involves the first Trump case scheduled for trial next year, a four-count indictment involving Trump's behaviour before the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
"The [prosecution] recognizes that this is an extraordinary request. This is an extraordinary case," Smith's team wrote in its filing.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, the Supreme Court announced it had agreed to expedite consideration of Smith's request. It ordered Trump's lawyers to respond by Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
What's unstated in Smith's filing: Trump is currently the frontrunner according to 2024 election polls, and if there's one case that's likely to derail his campaign, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
His other three legal battles include one less serious state case, or are more likely to be delayed until after the November 2024 election. 
</P>
<P>
But this one is supposed to happen early in the election calendar — on March 4, before Republicans finish nominating their candidate, and well before the general election.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution tries turbocharging appeals process
</P>
<P>
Unless the March 4 case is also delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Trump is claiming that he enjoys immunity from prosecution for events that occurred while he was president.
</P>
<P>
A criminal court ruled that wasn't the case: "[Trump's] four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade … criminal accountability," D.C. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week, Trump's lawyers served notice that he would appeal. They also argued that this automatically suspended the process for the case scheduled to go to trial March 4: "A stay of all further proceedings is mandatory and automatic," said their Dec. 7 filing.
</P>
<P>
Now, Smith is essentially attempting to turbocharge the process — to skip past the U.S. Court of Appeals and go straight to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
His filing Monday alludes to the broader political context.
</P>
<P>
"It is of paramount public importance" that the matter be resolved as "expeditiously as possible" in order to grant a fair and speedy trial, says the document.
</P>
<P>
"A Hail Mary," is how Trump referred to the move in a statement released Monday night. He called it a desperate act by a prosecutor obsessed with convicting him, and likened it to a prosecution worthy of a "Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts predicted months ago that this case would go to the Supreme Court. Those predictions are now coming to fruition.
</P>
<P>
Presidential immunity at heart of legal dispute
</P>
<P>
More recently, a pair of legal analysts had predicted in a Dec. 4 blog post that the biggest battle in this case would involve the pace of the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, they said, things look bad for Trump. 
</P>
<P>
In a post for the Lawfare blog, analysts Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes not only pointed to Chutkan's ruling, but identified a related ruling in a related civil case, where the U.S. Court of Appeals sided against Trump.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court dismissed Trump's expansive claims of presidential immunity from prosecution, concluding this immunity did not cover election-related activities.
</P>
<P>
The unanimous verdict was rendered by three judges appointed by three different presidents, including one appointed by Trump.
</P>
<P>
The legal analysts said the U.S. Supreme Court tends to respect such unanimous decisions from the appeals court in D.C.
</P>
<P>
"The already-bleak prospect [of] Trump avoiding a federal trial early in the new year got a little bleaker," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
Now, back to the reason these trials are making headlines around the world: The potential they might have to affect an American presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Trump is posting better survey numbers than at any point in his career: he's leading in the vast majority of general election polls against U.S. President Joe Biden, including some crushing numbers in recent swing-state polls.
</P>
<P>
He is free to run for president. In fact, the U.S. Constitution would even allow someone to run for president from a jail cell after being found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Trump has said that if he were re-elected, he would have the power to pardon himself and cancel any investigations, although he added he would rather not.
</P>
<P>
Yet a guilty verdict could reset the electoral math.
</P>
<P>
Numerous surveys over several months suggest a critical mass of voters would turn on Trump if he were convicted or sent to prison before election day.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Supreme Court is being asked to ensure a trial in time for that.

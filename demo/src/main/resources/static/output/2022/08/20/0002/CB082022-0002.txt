If ever there was proof lobster is king of Nova Scotia seafood, it's the new $36-million freight facility at Halifax Stanfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Air Cargo Logistics Park that opened earlier this month is a big bet that will continue. It's doubling cold storage capacity and adding apron space to park five 747-sized cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
"It increases the efficiency, the capacity and the ability to actually move and export more product from Nova Scotia," said Marie Manning, Halifax International Airport Authority's vice-president of business development and chief commercial officer.
</P>
<P>
"That benefits not only the airport, but certainly all of our stakeholders, the industry and the region itself. The economic impact is significant."
</P>
<P>
Seafood accounts for 91 per cent of exports from the airport — most of it live lobster.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12,757 tonnes of live lobster worth $293 million was flown out of Halifax.
</P>
<P>
Chinese company is anchor tenant
</P>
<P>
An anchor tenant in the new logistics park is First Catch, a Chinese company that came to Nova Scotia six years ago and is here for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
"We have a 25-year lease in the building," First Catch vice-president Lister Li told CBC News. "We want to work here in Halifax to make sure all our lobster has the best quality."
</P>
<P>
The company spent $9 million on its facilities at the Logistics Park, including a new cold storage room to hold shipments packed for flight.
</P>
<P>
The highlight is the so-called lobster shower.
</P>
<P>
It will allow First Catch to store about 40 tonnes of live lobster for extended periods, reducing mortality in case of flight delays or cancelled orders.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to solve problems," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The industry reckons it has about 60 hours to get a live lobster from the water to its final destination or it must go into storage or be cooked.
</P>
<P>
How the lobster shower works
</P>
<P>
At First Catch, live lobster can be unloaded and kept alive in plastic tubs under a cascade of water in a closed-circulation system which is the first of its kind in a Canadian airport.
</P>
<P>
The water will be drawn from a reservoir built underneath the building capable of holding 378,000 litres. First Catch has a similar but much larger facility at its hub airport in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"If we can save at least two per cent of what we export to China, it's still a lot of lobster. It's around 200,000 pounds. So it's a big saving," she said.
</P>
<P>
Charter inflation
</P>
<P>
The opening comes at a difficult time in the air charter business because of crew shortages, competition for space and instability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Li said chartering a cargo jet for a round trip to China costs $1.6 million US.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, First Catch reduced its charter flights into Halifax to one weekly.
</P>
<P>
Li said the company hopes to resume three charters a week when the lobster season opens in southwest Nova Scotia later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Cargojet
</P>
<P>
The other anchor tenant is Cargojet. The Canadian freight operator flies live lobster out of Halifax to Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The company said it's moving about 100 tonnes a week.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Leadbeater of freight management company Gateway said Halifax is positioning itself to be a hub.
</P>
<P>
"The lobster has always been here. It's just more of it's moving directly out of Halifax versus going Toronto, Montreal via the trucks. So we're having more airlines," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years he says cargo flights for lobster have increased from one or two a week to seven — from 160 tonnes a week to about 500 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
"We've gone way up," he said.

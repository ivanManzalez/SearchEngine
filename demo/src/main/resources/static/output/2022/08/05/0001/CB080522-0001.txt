<P>
Buyers of the Bellanca Building in downtown Yellowknife say they plan to convert the long-vacant office tower into apartments for rent.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that is what the city needs most at this time," Afzal Suri, a director of Borealis Development Inc., the company that bought the Bellanca, wrote in an email. 
</P>
<P>
As first reported by Cabin Radio, Borealis Development Inc. proposes converting the former federal government office building into a 72-unit apartment building called "The Nest," complete with a penthouse suite, gym and retail space at the ground level. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a housing crunch and ongoing efforts by the city to spruce up the downtown core, such a development comes as welcome news to some. 
</P>
<P>
"In our downtown, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. Somebody thinks the Bellanca Building has some opportunity, so good on them," said city councillor and builder Niels Konge.
</P>
<P>
"For me, anytime private business wants to do investment, it's a great thing. It's way better than government doing it. Government screws up almost everything they touch."

Bellanca sat empty for a decade
</P>
<P>
The Bellanca's former owner, real estate investment giant KingSett Capital, let the 10-storey building sit empty and falling into disrepair for a decade. One windy day in 2018, about five storeys' worth of siding fell off the exterior — it was never replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto-based KingSett Capital owns several office buildings in Yellowknife's downtown, and is part-owner of Northview Canadian High Yield Residential Fund, the city's most prominent commercial and residential landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Borealis Development bought the Bellanca and the neighbouring parking lot for $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed with N.W.T. Corporate Registries, Borealis Development incorporated in August 2021 and has two directors: Suri, and Mansoor Ahmad Anjum.
</P>
<P>
Suri is the store manager of The Brick in Yellowknife, and Anjum is the store's owner.
</P>
<P>
Anjum couldn't be reached for comment. Suri declined an interview request, asking instead to answer questions via email. 
</P>
<P>
Suri said the company plans to begin construction before the end of this year, with the hope of opening the building to the public in 2024.
</P>
<P>
When asked if any of the units would be offered as affordable rentals, Suri wrote: "No comment." He also declined to comment on the development's estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
The city approved a development permit for the Bellanca's lots, subject to certain conditions. People who say they'll be adversely affected by the project had until Thursday afternoon to appeal it. 
</P>
<P>
The city did not respond to CBC's questions about whether anyone had made an appeal.

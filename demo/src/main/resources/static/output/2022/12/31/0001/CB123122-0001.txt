Influx of newcomers taxing Calgary service groups; some say outdated policies a problem; 
</P>
<P>
Canada expected to receive and support 500,000 new immigrants per year by 2025

Lorraine was out of work as an administrator and desperate to find some help to feed her family when she did a quick Google search for "Calgary food resources" and stumbled upon the Women's Centre of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
That was three years ago. Now she volunteers and is astonished by how many more people are knocking on the agency's door.
</P>
<P>
"Wow, there is a big influx of people coming in, women with children especially. And when we are sitting at the table, they talk and they say, 'I wish I could come every week to pick up a hamper because sometimes we got no food at home at all,'" said Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
Since opening in the early 1970s, the Women's Centre of Calgary has supported and connected women living in poverty, fleeing abuse or just needing a place to get their bearings straight when first arriving from another country.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the relatively recent arrival of so many immigrants and refugees from Ukraine, Afghanistan and other parts of the world, the centre has seen a 300 to 600 per cent increase in need for resources, including food, personal care items and clothing.
</P>
<P>
For example, it went from providing 1,330 emergency food hampers in the third quarter of last year to 3,090 over that same period this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are honestly feeling very inundated and overwhelmed with the need in Calgary right now," said Bo Masterson, executive director of the Women's Centre.
</P>
<P>
The centre is working with other associations to try to meet the need. 
</P>
<P>
"Some calls to action include donating to the centre, and also connecting with us to volunteer," said Monique Greenwood, the centre's project manager.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Centre
</P>
<P>
According to the federal government, Calgary is expecting to welcome 30,000 immigrants per year by 2025 to help ease labour shortages and fuel the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
And it's not just the women's centre that is struggling to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest issue that we're facing right now is, is simply the volume. The volume of people are simply so high that we can barely keep up," said Kelly Ernst, who is vice-president of vulnerable populations for the Centre for Newcomers.
</P>
<P>
Ernst says it's not just the volume of singles and families arriving, but their needs are varied and complex.
</P>
<P>
"So, for example, we're having to make sure that we're hiring case managers who only are working with Afghan women," said Ernst.
</P>
<P>
"We're also trying to set up language classes that are trying to address the particular needs of the Ukrainian community."
</P>
<P>
Outdated policies
</P>
<P>
Ernst says Canada's immigration policies were developed several decades ago but the needs have changed a lot since then.
</P>
<P>
"You can't just say we're going to accept all these people and then not have the legislation behind it and the policy behind it to support it," said Ernst.
</P>
<P>
He says it seems officials aren't aware of the toll an influx of refugees and immigrants will take on housing — and the speed with which that needs to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
As well, Ernst says some government processes are still slow and backlogged due to COVID. So he says there are long wait lists for work permits, permanent residency and social insurance numbers.
</P>
<P>
He also says there need to be changes, with respect to the way refugee claimant applications are processed. 
</P>
<P>
He says sometimes it can take 18 months for a refugee's application to be processed, and until it's approved, the person is not eligible for English classes.
</P>
<P>
Ernst says that means the refugee may struggle to find work, work under the table, or end up in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
"All of those things are not helping our economy in the way that we would like that person to be helping and contributing. He wants to contribute."
</P>
<P>
Doing what it can
</P>
<P>
CBC News reached out to the federal department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to respond to some of these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it was working with refugees and service providers to address these issues.
</P>
<P>
"Eligible clients may experience some wait times for language training as service providers work with them to find the courses best suited to them. Where wait-lists do exist, service providers generally prioritize refugee clients and we will continue working with them in managing this issue," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In an email, a spokesperson for the provincial ministry of of Trade, Immigration and Multiculturalism said it is addressing gaps.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to work with key stakeholders and community groups to ensure we address gaps in newcomer programs and services," the email said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Women's Centre of Calgary says it will continue to do what it can to keep up with the growing need by appealing to donors and applying for grants — now and into the future — to help people like Lorraine, who admits it wasn't easy asking for help.
</P>
<P>
But she's glad she did.
</P>
<P>
"Once you join the programs, doors open up for you. And don't feel bad to ask. If you don't ask, you don't receive," said Lorraine.

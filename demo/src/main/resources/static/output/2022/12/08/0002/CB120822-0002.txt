The mobile app that will allow Halifax Transit riders to pay for a bus or ferry ride with their phone won't roll out until 2023.
</P>
<P>
There was some talk about the app potentially being ready in December, but a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Municipality told CBC News in an email the contract with the U.K. company Masabi is still being finalized.
</P>
<P>
The municipality estimates the app could be available eight weeks after a contract is signed.
</P>
<P>
Halifax regional council originally approved the plan to move to a mobile app in July 2020, with a goal of going cashless by 2025.
</P>
<P>
In July, council voted to award Masabi the job of delivering the service to buses and ferries.
</P>
<P>
Masabi's app works by displaying a ticket on the screen to show the driver. It would be similar to using a paper bus transfer.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the buses and ferries will have scanners for the app, but that's expected to come about nine months after the app first launches.
</P>
<P>
After the scanners are installed, the next move will be to allow payment through tapping a debit or credit card on their screens.

Premier Jason Kenney provided an outline Tuesday of the province's new jobs program, which he said will help Alberta continue its post-pandemic economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
The program, called Alberta at Work, will invest $600 million set aside in the 2022 budget into meeting the needs of the labour market. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney said it will focus on removing barriers to employment, reskilling people for career transitions and attracting and retaining young workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you are a newcomer to Alberta, you're returning to work after a long period of unemployment or you have a disability, we want to make sure that you find a meaningful job in this province," said Kenney. 
</P>
<P>
The premier also emphasized the importance of integrating more women, new immigrants and Indigenous workers into Alberta's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaycee Madu, Alberta's minister of labour and immigration, said that under the program, $23 million will go toward continuing the Canada-Alberta job grant, which helps employers hire and train Alberta workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We see companies move into Alberta or expand into creating new jobs and there aren't enough people with the necessary skills to share in Alberta's success," said Madu. 
</P>
<P>
Investing in education
</P>
<P>
Demetrios Nicolaides, Alberta's minister of advanced education, said substantial new funding for the province's post-secondary education system will help address the province's structural unemployment issues. 
</P>
<P>
"By making more financial supports available, we are ensuring that post-secondary education stays accessible to everyone, especially at this critical time in our province," said Nicolaides.
</P>
<P>
He said $171 million will be allocated over the next three years to target enrolment growth, with the aim to create 7,000 new spots in post-secondary programs relating to finance, health care, civil and computer engineering, apprenticeship and education.
</P>
<P>
"The skilled trades are part of our province's great history, and the apprenticeship education model has as much value as other forms of post-secondary education," said Nicolaides.
</P>
<P>
Money has also been allocated to expand the province's apprenticeship and micro-credential programs and to continue existing scholarships and fund new low income bursaries.

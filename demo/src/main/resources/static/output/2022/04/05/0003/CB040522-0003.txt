Canadian energy company Suncor says it is getting rid of its wind and solar assets.
</P>
<P>
In a news release Monday, the Calgary-based company says it still intends to be net-zero emissions by 2050, but will accelerate progress towards that target by focusing on hydrogen and renewable fuels instead.
</P>
<P>
Suncor says its strategy for hitting the 2050 goal is also focused on increasing shareholder returns.
</P>
<P>
The company says it has developed eight wind power projects since 2002 in three provinces ⁠— Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The news release says efforts to hit the 2050 net-zero goal also include replacing coke-fired boilers at its Base Plant oilsands project near Fort McMurray, Alta., with lower emission cogeneration units, as well as accelerating commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture technology.
</P>
<P>
It also notes it's partnering with ATCO on a project to build a world-scale hydrogen project in Alberta and deploying next-generation renewable fuel technologies like LanzaJet's sustainable aviation fuel technology and Enerkem's waste-to-fuels technology.

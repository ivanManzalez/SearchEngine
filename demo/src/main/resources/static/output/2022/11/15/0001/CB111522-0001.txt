No one was injured during an early morning duplex fire in Eastern Passage, N.S., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency received a call about a fire on McKay Lane around 7:45 a.m. AT. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dean, the assistant deputy chief, said the structure was "fully involved" when crews arrived.
</P>
<P>
"[The fire] was through the roof so they immediately went into defensive operations, which means they fought the fire from the exterior," Dean said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Several crews were called in to fight the fire, and Dean said a tanker was called to assist with water supply.
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished by mid-morning. Dean said the building has "extensive damage" but all residents were able to get out safely.
</P>
<P>
He said fire investigators are now on scene, and the cause is still to be determined.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Red Cross was also called in to assist the residents with emergency needs. Six people were displaced by the fire.

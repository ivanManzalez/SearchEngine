The National Capital Commission is again turning a road beside the Rideau Canal in Ottawa into a multi-use path to let people get distanced outdoor exercise.
</P>
<P>
Starting Jan. 15, Queen Elizabeth Driveway will be closed to vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. between Somerset Street West in Centretown and Fifth Avenue in the Glebe.
</P>
<P>
It may have to pause this at times if winter weather requires the road to be cleared, the NCC said in a statement. The organization has announced similar closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including in January 2021.
</P>
<P>
The statement didn't include an end date.
</P>
<P>
As for exercise on the Rideau Canal Skateway itself, the NCC said in an email Wednesday that preparations are well underway to reach the 30 centimetres of thickness required to open.

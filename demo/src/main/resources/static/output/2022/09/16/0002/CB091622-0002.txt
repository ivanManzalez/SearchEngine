<P>
The federal government has set aside up to $250 million over four years for a new program aimed at making home heating more affordable for households across the country — especially in Atlantic Canada, where 30 per cent of homeowners still use furnace oil to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
Of the $250 million, $118.4 million is earmarked for Atlantic Canadian provinces where using oil for home heating is more common, according to a release from Environment and Climate Change Canada.
</P>
<P>
The money will be given to provinces and territories through the Low Carbon Economy Fund, with a focus on helping low-income households make the switch from fossil fuels to more efficient heating systems, like electric heat pumps. 
</P>
<P>
The government says moving from heating oil to a heat pump can save homeowners thousands of dollars each year. 
</P>
<P>
Greener, cheaper
</P>
<P>
Steven Guilbeault, minister of environment and climate change, made the announcement Thursday in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund will help Canadians access greener, cheaper home heating.
</P>
<P>
"This new funding can be stacked with other federal and provincial incentives, so that up to 100 per cent of the cost of a new heat pump may be covered for low-income households," said Guilbeault. 
</P>
<P>
Funds will be given to provincial and territorial governments through the Low Carbon Economy Fund to expand current energy efficiency programs.
</P>
<P>
Kody Bloise, MP for Kings-Hants, said the cost of electric heat pumps is a big barrier for homeowners who want to stop using oil. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many families across the country who have already made a transition. They've invested in a heat pump or made their homes more energy efficient," Bloise said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, we know that there are some families that simply do not have the means in order to be able to do so."
</P>
<P>
Bloise said the funding will make a difference in people's lives by reducing energy bills. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a priority to support vulnerable households to transition energy sources in light of global oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a release that allocation of funds by province is not yet finalized.

Why Spring Garden Road's bus-only pilot project failed; 
</P>
<P>
Traffic planners tell city committee the problem was construction and confusing, inconsistent signs
</P>

<P>
A municipal committee has asked city staff for an improved plan to revive the pilot project banning cars from Spring Garden Road next summer.
</P>
<P>
Traffic planners came to a special meeting of Halifax's transportation standing committee Wednesday to explain why the first attempt at the experiment fell apart after four days in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the pilot didn't work as intended and had significant challenges," said transportation planning manager Mike Connors. 
</P>
<P>
In December 2021, regional council directed staff to run the car-free pilot project for a year. But Connors listed a number of factors that interfered.
</P>
<P>
"Construction on Spring Garden Road and the surrounding area has taken longer than expected and has added challenges to the operation of the pilot," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other challenge was getting the message out to the driving public.
</P>
<P>
"Traffic restrictions on Spring Garden Road for the pilot are more difficult to communicate to drivers than we had originally expected. It is now clear that a more robust traffic control plan will be required," said Connors.
</P>
<P>
Quieter, calmer
</P>
<P>
The plan was to stop cars from entering Spring Garden Road between Queen and South Park streets from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Transit buses and cyclists were still allowed.
</P>
<P>
Connors said the pilot worked well when there were police stationed at those intersections to keep cars from entering the street, and to explain the new rules.
</P>
<P>
He said the road was significantly quieter and calmer during those periods, and pedestrians could navigate the area more easily.
</P>
<P>
But police staff shortages meant officers were not always available. So during busy times, drivers ignored the signs and drove on the road as usual.
</P>
<P>
Ineffective signs
</P>
<P>
Connors also told the committee the signs that were put up warn drivers not to enter Spring Garden Road could be improved.
</P>
<P>
He said signs with a green circle and forward arrow listing the times when drivers were allowed to cross the street could be replaced with red "no turn" and "do not enter" signs.
</P>
<P>
He also raised the possibility of a permanent, or semi-permanent barrier with a mechanical gate.
</P>
<P>
The bridge toll transponder in transit buses could activate the gate, but it would keep cars and trucks away.
</P>
<P>
Connors said Banff, Alta., has such a system, but staff would need to study if it can be used here.
</P>
<P>
Cancel and relaunch
</P>
<P>
"When you do a pilot, and when you attempt to do something new, sometimes it's not going to work, and we know that, and this didn't work," said Coun. Waye Mason, who is a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that "do not enter" signs will do a better job grabbing drivers' attention.
</P>
<P>
"The signs that say, 'You can do this,' don't work as well as the one saying, 'You can't do this.'"
</P>
<P>
But Coun. Paul Russell had doubts.
</P>
<P>
"I would have to see strong justification of why one sign would work better than the other when signs inherently are less effective than physical measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russell said one-way side streets such as Birmingham Street and Brenton Street should have been switched to two-way traffic to allow local residents to come and go.
</P>
<P>
The committee voted to cancel the original pilot project, which has been officially "paused" since July.
</P>
<P>
The members have now directed the city's CAO to come up with a better plan and have it ready by March, which will hopefully allow another attempt in the summer of 2023.
</P>
<P>
"The message I want to give to the public is … There's good reasons to delay it, but we're doing it. And that it's not going to slide further to the right," Mason said.

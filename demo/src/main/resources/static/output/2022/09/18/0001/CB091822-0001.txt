Advocacy group lobbies for landlord licensing;

'It's not a God-given right to provide housing just because you own it,' says advocate

About a dozen people rallied in front of an apartment complex in Dartmouth on Saturda to call on the Halifax Regional Municipality to develop a licensing policy for rental property owners to ensure the safety and health of tenants.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a God-given right to provide housing just because you own it," said Hannah Wood, the chair of ACORN's peninsular Halifax chapter, which advocates for people of low or moderate income. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be something that you are monitored to do because unfortunately a good-faith system just doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
Wood said sometimes tenants refuse to report their landlords to the city out of fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
She said ACORN wants HRM to impose a fee on landlords of $1 per unit per month to license their buildings. That would put them on a city registry for safety inspections every year.
</P>
<P>
"We have tenants in ACORN who are dealing with rats, cockroaches, mice, bedbugs — every kind of infestation you can imagine. Not to mention heating systems that don't work, and air conditioning systems that don't work," said Wood.
</P>
<P>
She said buildings in poor condition often end up demolished, leading to less affordable housing in HRM. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions around licensing landlords have been happening in Halifax since 2016.
</P>
<P>
While some councillors have supported the idea, one said licensing all apartments in the region would be difficult to regulate and the responsibility should fall to insurers.
</P>
<P>
Coun. Waye Mason has pushed for licensing to keep a minimum safety standard in the city.
</P>
<P>
Windsor, Ont., began a two-year pilot project earlier this year where rental units would need to be licensed in some parts of the city. Toronto and London, Ont., already have the measure in place.
</P>
<P>
Conditions in other cities improved after licensing
</P>
<P>
Scott Leon, a housing researcher from the Wellesley Institute, said conditions of rental buildings in Toronto seemed to improve after landlord licensing was implemented a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"In that way, it could be looked at as a success," said Leon. 
</P>
<P>
He said landlords pay about $11 per unit in Toronto. With ACORN asking HRM to implement a $1 fee per unit per month, he says it's really not much.

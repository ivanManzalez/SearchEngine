Alberta sees its biggest population boom in years — mostly from Ontario;

It's the largest net gain since Q2 of 2014, says ATB Financial

Alberta is experiencing the kind population gains not seen in years, according to new figures from Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
Data from the federal agency shows nearly 10,000 more people relocated to the province from other parts of the country in the second quarter of the year than left.
</P>
<P>
It also shows Alberta was the leading destination among Canadians moving from Ontario, B.C., Saskatchewan, Yukon and, narrowly, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
ATB Financial said this is the largest net gain since the second quarter of 2014, when the province experienced a wave of new arrivals as the oil economy boomed. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures also reveal the fourth-consecutive quarter in which Alberta's population grew as a result of interprovincial migration, according to ATB.
</P>
<P>
Its deputy chief economist, Rob Roach, said the continued momentum is an indicator that something is going right in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Between "the third quarter of 2015 and early 2021, we lost about almost 50,000 people to other parts of the country," Roach told CBC News.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, we've gained in total about 21,000-22,000. So we're making up for the ground that we lost, really, when our economy was suffering from the recession."
</P>
<P>
Volatility important to consider
</P>
<P>
Influxes usually occur in Alberta as a response to strong economic conditions and high oil prices, said University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe.
</P>
<P>
"When times are good, with high oil prices, we tend to consistently see big inflows into the province, and these numbers are consistent with that," Tombe said.
</P>
<P>
But it's also important to remember, he said, that inflows to Alberta can be quite volatile.
</P>
<P>
"If oil prices decline as they have in recent months, we could see a very quick reversal of the pattern," he said.
</P>
<P>
Still, Roach said ATB is expecting that, on the whole, Alberta will grow at a greater rate than the country and "that's going to draw people naturally to the province for those economic opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"Quite a contrast [to] where our economy and energy sector was struggling and we were dealing with the pandemic [in 2020]," Roach said.
</P>
<P>
"This time around, our economy and energy sector [are] doing well, while we deal with the other economic challenges, like inflation going on. So [it] puts Alberta in a bit better position."
</P>
<P>
Demographics 
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada's numbers show that 37,122 interprovincial migrants came to Alberta while 27,265 people left the province.
</P>
<P>
The net gain was composed primarily of Ontarians.
</P>
<P>
Tombe said those who arrived are younger — primarily in their mid-20s — which is beneficial for the economy as they are likely to produce more than they consume and pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
When we look at a strained rental market, however, the outlook gets more complicated.
</P>
<P>
"No question, when you have an increase in an area's population, then you're going to have an increase in demand for housing," Tombe said.
</P>
<P>
"We would expect this would manifest itself in the form of, if not higher rents, [then] lower vacancies, and a more competitive rental market. It also has implications for the price of homes."

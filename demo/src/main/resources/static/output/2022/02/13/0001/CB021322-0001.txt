Toronto woman loses life savings in romance scam, warns others to 'be careful'; 
</P>

'Unfortunately, this type of crime isn't uncommon,' Toronto police say

When a handsome stranger started chatting with Cindy Browne on TikTok, she was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
They quickly took their courtship to WhatsApp and bonded over their shared difficulty in love: He told her his wife had died of cancer. She told him her first husband had also died and she'd recently found out her second husband was cheating on her. 
</P>
<P>
"[He] WhatsApped me every day, so nicely talking," said Browne. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell for him." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later, Browne says the man she thought she was building a life with had scammed her out of about $26,000 in a type of scheme the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Toronto police confirmed they're investigating, and said "unfortunately, this type of crime isn't uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
'Drastic' increase in romance scams
</P>
<P>
Jeff Horncastle, a unit supervisor with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a story that we hear far, far too often," said Horncastle, who noted that romance scams have seen a "drastic" increase in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 2020, the fraud centre registered a reported loss of nearly $28 million due to romance scams in Canada. In 2021, that number more than doubled to more than $64 million – though Horncastle believes that may be an underestimate, as people are often reluctant to report this type of crime. Last year, romance scams accounted for the second-highest amount of dollars lost to fraud in Canada, the centre said. 
</P>
<P>
Horncastle said some warning signs that could point to a potential scam include: 
</P>
<P>
Browne's purported sweetheart called himself Fabian, and said he was a pilot based in Jordan. About two months after they started chatting, he asked for her clothing size and said he planned to send gifts from his travels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian told her she'd have to pay a fee to have the gifts delivered.
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe the fee was going to cost me, about $30 or $20 or $100 or something," she said.
</P>
<P>
But when she got a call from someone who claimed to work for a courier company holding the gifts, Browne was told the fee would cost $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
When she asked Fabian about this, he told her that there was $150,000 inside the gift. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked, Browne asked him why and said he told her he'd "fallen in love with me and then we're going to settle down in Canada."
</P>
<P>
Browne was uncertain. Still, she did as she was told and sent the $1,500 using a nearby BitCoin ATM. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't end there. The company kept asking for more money – and threatening legal trouble if she didn't pay up. She even dipped into funds she'd been saving to fly to Singapore to visit her mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
Horncastle noted that scammers aren't amateurs; they will put a lot of care into constructing a persona their victims will find appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"These criminals unfortunately know exactly what these people want to hear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They know how to manipulate them, they know how to play with their emotions, and unfortunately, that's why they're able to get so much money out of these victims." 
</P>
<P>
'I never thought that wasn't real'
</P>
<P>
At one point, Browne said she asked Fabian why he didn't pay the fee since he was a pilot.
</P>
<P>
"Fabian told me: because Qatar airlines hold his account," she said. "And then I just never [thought] that wasn't real." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Browne had cleared out her savings, and was considering selling her car to get more cash.
</P>
<P>
The situation finally came to an end when Browne, who manages a car wash, was visibly distraught at work. A police officer who was a regular customer asked her what was wrong, and when she described the situation, he urged her to report it.
</P>
<P>
"The officer called me five days later and then they said, 'You've been scammed,'" she said. 
</P>
<P>
'Be careful'
</P>
<P>
At the time, Browne didn't confide to friends or family about what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she wants to share her story to warn others about the risk of romance scams. 
</P>
<P>
"Just be careful when you don't know the person, you never meet them and they start fall[ing] in love with you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to protecting yourself online, Horncastle said: 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Horncastle said, don't ever send money to someone you haven't met. Browne agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It already happened to me," she said.

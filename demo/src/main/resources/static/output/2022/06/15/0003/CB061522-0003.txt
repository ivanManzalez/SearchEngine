Regina to allow backyard suites across entire city; 
</P>
<P>
City received generally positive feedback during pilot projects
</P>

<P>
Regina city council has voted to allow developers and homeowners to build backyard suites anywhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, construction of backyard suites — also known as laneway and garden suites — was only permitted in three areas of the city as part of a series of pilot projects that date back to 2013. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report presented to city council Wednesday, the pilot projects were generally well received. 
</P>
<P>
After a unanimous 9-0 vote on Wednesday, the rest of the city may get to experience the suites soon.
</P>
<P>
The next step is for the city solicitor to write the approved changes into the bylaws and bring those changes back to council for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Focus on infill 
</P>
<P>
On top of allowing backyard suites city-wide, the motion passed by council would extend a five-year, 25 per cent tax exemption for council-approved backyard suites to residents in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The tax exemption would not be applied to the areas in blue in the map below:
</P>
<P>
The city classifies backyard suites as a dwelling unit separate from a primary dwelling on a residential lot. 
</P>
<P>
They're different from secondary suites — such as basement suites  — and row buildings — semi-detached or town homes — both of which are already permitted.
</P>
<P>
How Regina got here
</P>
<P>
Regina has operated a series of pilot projects that took a cautious approach to introducing backyard suites. 
</P>
<P>
The first occurred in 2013, with 11 properties in the Greens on Gardiner neighbourhood being targeted for development of backyard suites. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the city allowed the development of more backyard suites on 20 properties in the Harbour Landing neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
In 2016, a third pilot project involved six different properties in established neighbourhoods throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
The units in the three pilot programs had dramatic differences in location, context and layout, allowing the city to get a better idea about what was viewed as acceptable and to assess public interest in backyard suites. 
</P>
<P>
While not all of the properties saw backyard suites built on them, the city still views it as a worthwhile experiment, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Feedback collected in response to the pilot projects indicates that 43 people were interested in applying for permission to construct a unit on their property in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
That figure grew to 66 people who were interested in applying in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
City administration believe that anywhere from three to 15 backyard suites would be built per year.
</P>
<P>
What backyard suites could look like
</P>
<P>
City administration's report says backyard suites could come in two formats.
</P>
<P>
The first would look similar to what was allowed under the third pilot project: a two-storey building with the main floor serving as a garage to the main residential structure and potentially to the tenant of the backyard suite.
</P>
<P>
The second storey of the building would then serve as the residential unit.
</P>
<P>
The other option is a single-storey ground-oriented backyard suite that would resemble any other accessory building such as a garage, but would be fully equipped as a living space.
</P>
<P>
The height of any building would be limited to 5.8 metres and they'd be set back further from the laneway than in previous pilot projects.

My mom and my brother eyed my chubby ceramic piggy bank. I met their gaze and nodded my head. Even at roughly six years old, I had a strong sense of duty toward my family. It had to be done. I got to do the honours — SMASH!
</P>
<P>
My little piggy was in a million pieces. 
</P>
<P>
This sounds like a sad story — like we hit rock bottom. But it wasn't sad for me. I felt hope, the possibility of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
That smiling piggy I haggled for at a flea market taught me that I had agency, that I could change my circumstances. It was where my adventure of independence, optimism and courage began.
</P>
<P>
I grew up poor in an abusive, alcoholic household and fought my way from dingy bars in South Africa into boardrooms here in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The kind of poor I endured is not the kind of poverty you might see on the international news from a war-torn village plagued with disease and starvation but rather a self-inflicted scarcity. The mismanagement of money fuelled my dad's addiction and keeping up appearances had dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
My parents were teachers with modest salaries. But all our money went to my dad's booze buddies — drinks were always on him or lending someone this and then owing someone that. As a child, I spent many hours in the bar with him. But when the drinking stopped, that's when the shouting and fighting began. His anger was aimed at my mom.
</P>
<P>
My mom tried her best. She loved us and kept us fed. She took on my dad's debt, hid his drinking problem from everyone else and worked extra jobs.
</P>
<P>
I did not want to be a martyr like my mom.
</P>
<P>
The first time I saw that piggy bank at the market, it was sitting on a table amidst all kinds of other second-hand goods from kitchenware to ornaments. I was only about four years old, but somehow I had the thought that it was going to make things better and that's why I had to have it.
</P>
<P>
Then for two years, I saved — everything from my birthday money from my granny to fishing out leftover coins in slot machines at the bar to money I was supposed to put in the collection plate at church. In my child's mind, I figured Jesus knew we were poor, too. 
</P>
<P>
We smashed the piggy bank in the middle of winter, when our electricity had just been cut off again and the pantry shelves didn't have a single cracker or soup can left. My mom didn't tell me to do, it but I volunteered.
</P>
<P>
I remember wrapping the piggy in a rag and smashing it on the kitchen table. I don't remember my mom's face, but I was proud. It had South African rand roughly the equivalent of $200 CAD today — enough to put gas in the car and buy groceries, plus some candles for light. 
</P>
<P>
It changed my life, because it changed my outlook. I suddenly believed my situation was temporary, that I was able to face any challenge and I could make my life better.
</P>
<P>
But life was still hard. At 14, I survived being hit by a car while walking outside our house. My dad was the driver and he was drunk. I had a concussion, but somehow I got up, walked into the house and passed out again. When I showed up bruised at school the following Monday, I told everyone exactly what happened and spoke my truth without shying away from it.
</P>
<P>
I was teased about it. I didn't care. This was temporary.
</P>
<P>
In my final school year, this courage also helped me convince my mom to move out. I couldn't protect her from my father's rage when I wasn't there. And then I found the courage to move even further away.
</P>
<P>
My partner and I had a long-term goal of moving to Canada — a country that's much safer and where we would have the freedom to live without judgment. So in spring 2020, we packed up everything we could and sold the rest.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after we got to Calgary, the whole world went into lockdown. I eventually found the job I wanted, but lost it a month later when the company went bankrupt. Another dream smashed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
But I could rebuild. I've learned that. I work in the competitive industry of retail. Applying the skills of frugality and persistence that my piggy taught me, I worked my way up to be a senior merchant.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic setbacks during the pandemic, I am proud to say that I now work for my dream employer doing what I love. I pitch clothing and other product lines in executive boardrooms and it feels so far removed from those dingy bars and the home I grew up in. Still, I'm grateful now for the childhood I had and especially for that piggy bank. It helped shape me into the person I am today. 
</P>
<P>
I am a fighter. I am scrappy, and I look forward to whatever is next.

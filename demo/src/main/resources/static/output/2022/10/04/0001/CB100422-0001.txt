Where to live when you can't find an affordable rental? For this woman — it's her SUV; 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Dahoy has been looking for a room to rent since this summer
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Courtney Dahoy, 34, moved back to Calgary this summer for work, after a short period spent living in Camrose. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she said, the job is going well. But amid Calgary's tight rental market, the search for a place to live is not.
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to find a room to rent for like $600, $500," said Dahoy, an artist with a day job in event set-up and tear-down. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, she said the going rate seems to be $800 or $900 — and sometimes, there's nothing available at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sometimes a little discouraging."
</P>
<P>
Dahoy is confident she'll find something sooner or later. But without a better option in front of her, she's now living out of her SUV. 
</P>
<P>
"I've camped before — so it's just a smaller camp space, and more city life," said Dahoy.
</P>
<P>
It's not a perfect situation, she said, but it's not that bad. Through a mix of internet research and trial and error, she has found parking lots throughout the city that are friendly to travellers and people living out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, she said, she's not the only one out there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a trend these days," she said. 
</P>
<P>
How common is this?
</P>
<P>
It's a difficult trend to put into numbers. Data isn't tracked about the number of people in Calgary who don't have a fixed address and are instead couch surfing, sleeping in their cars or finding other temporary arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But anecdotal evidence suggests their numbers may be growing. 
</P>
<P>
The YWCA told CBC Calgary its outreach team has noticed more victims of domestic violence staying in their vehicles because there aren't enough affordable rentals.
</P>
<P>
Chaz Smith, with the street outreach organization BeTheChangeYYC, said he, too, is aware of people in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
And Trystan Taylor, an employee at a Calgary campground, said the number of people trying to live at the campground  — rather than staying there recreationally — has been up about threefold over previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
University of Calgary social work professor Jeannette Waegemakers Schiff said this isn't surprising. She said homelessness has risen during the pandemic and been made worse by inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people who are experiencing homelessness or housing precarity are actually people who are not staying in shelters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the people who are couch surfing, they're sleeping in their cars, they're sleeping in tents during the summertime." 
</P>
<P>
Waegemakers Schiff said it doesn't need to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be the political will to say that housing becomes social responsibility and not just a privilege."
</P>
<P>
Staying positive
</P>
<P>
As for the word "homeless," Dahoy doesn't think it describes her. As long as she has her vehicle, she has a roof over her head and protection from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Work and the search for a rental keeps her busy during the day. Tim Hortons and McDonald's are frequent haunts, she said, because of the free Wi-Fi.
</P>
<P>
At night, she stays alert and keeps a sun visor up for privacy and safety. And while most people in the parking lots keep to themselves, she said there's some comfort in knowing she's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the same folks around and they look like they're decent people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dahoy does worry about the coming winter. Still, she believes in staying positive and, when all else fails, turns to music for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"You Won't Break My Soul — Beyoncé — that song is pretty much repeating in my head if I find myself getting down," she said.

<P>
The future of Juno Beach — and the centre commemorating the scene of the iconic Canadian Second World War battle — has been secured.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has agreed to help buy land from a developer that was planning to build condos near the historic site.
</P>
<P>
The investment brings to an end an emotional struggle for many Canadian veterans and their families.
</P>
<P>
On June 6, 1944, 340 Canadian soldiers died and more than 800 were wounded while taking the beach from dug-in German defenders. It was a key event in the D-Day invasion and the war.
</P>
<P>
The land that had been slated for development borders the Juno Beach Centre, a privately operated Canadian museum.
</P>
<P>
For more than two years, the museum had been engaged in a legal battle with French developer Foncim, which had planned to construct two buildings with 66 condos near the beach. Construction was set to begin as early as this fall.

"We have piles of Canadians who've written to me and the prime minister," said Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay on Friday after the official announcement.
</P>
<P>
"Working with the French government and the town, we were able to stop it, and I am so pleased the land [will] be preserved for years to come."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the local council in Courseulles-Sur-Mer decided to purchase the land with help from the Canadian and French governments in order to preserve the site. Canada's contribution will be about $4 million. How much France is chipping in was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The deal to secure the beachfront area will proceed in two steps, said an official in MacAulay's office speaking on background before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
An upfront cash payment will cover the cost of securing the land and reimbursing the developer for remediation that has already taken place. A 99-year lease of the property will be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Remembering those who 'fought for freedom'
</P>
<P>
Michel Miraillet, France's ambassador to Canada, said preserving the site was vital to the French government and it took negotiation with the municipal government to get the deal.
</P>
<P>
And in light of recent events in eastern Europe, he added, holding on to a reminder of the sacrifices of the Second World War is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
"In this present time, where freedom is contested and some countries face Russian aggression, I think it's very simple to maintain the souvenirs and remembrance of those who fought for freedom," Miraillet said.
</P>
<P>
Retired brigadier-general Ernest Beno, the director of the Juno Beach Centre, said the centre is relieved to see the dispute resolved. He and the executive director of the centre, Alex Fitzgerald-Black, said support in the community of Courseulles-Sur-Mer was extremely important.
</P>
<P>
A pro-development town council originally pushed the project forward. It became a local issue and one of the deciding aspects of the local municipal election in 2020, which saw the council replaced with one that was willing to negotiate over the future of the site, said Fitzgerald-Black.
</P>
<P>
'A step too far for Canadians'
</P>
<P>
"It's really important to understand, especially in this part of France," he said. "In Normandy, you know, our museum directors are descendants of people who were liberated by Canadians, and they understand that history, and they understand how important it is."
</P>
<P>
The condo development "was a step too far for Canadians," said Cindy Clegg of the Save Juno Beach campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to save Juno Beach from development told Canadians what was happening in France, at a time when authorities were looking the other way," she said. "It should never have gotten to this point.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians make a promise every Remembrance Day to never forget the sacrifices made for future generations. And this year, we forced our government to step up and protect the legacy and reputation of our country as an ally and force for good in a war-torn world."
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the developer and the Juno Beach Centre was largely about the use of a road — Voie des Français Libres — constructed and operated by the museum.
</P>
<P>
Foncim planned to use the road during the construction. The museum tried to block access to the developer on the grounds that construction — which it called an "existential threat" — would disrupt access to the site.
</P>
<P>
In April, MacAulay vowed to do "everything possible" to resolve the dispute after meeting with the mayor of Courseulles-sur-Mer and the French minister delegate for remembrance and veterans to stress the importance of commemorating the Canadians who died at Juno.
</P>
<P>
"My job is to indicate how important paying respect and commemoration is, and, of course, to indicate how important Juno Beach is to Canada, because a lot of our blood has been spilled here," MacAulay said at the time.

On the day MacAulay made that statement, then-Conservative veterans affairs critic Frank Caputo and NDP veterans affairs critic Rachel Blaney also toured the museum in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, MacAulay called the battle at Juno Beach one of the most ambitious military operations the world has ever seen, saying that protecting it for posterity is important for not only for Canada, but for France as well.
</P>
<P>
"The story of Juno Beach and the Battle of Normandy, and the brave folks who fought there, represent a vitally important chapter in our history. This agreement will safeguard and preserve this portion of Juno Beach for future generations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But following the announcement, Caputo took to Twitter to criticize MacAulay for not acting sooner.
</P>
<P>
"That it took pressure from thousands of Canadians, a mandate from the Veterans Affairs committee and petitions from myself and other members of Parliament while standing on Juno Beach itself for the minister to make this common-sense decision is a sad reality," he said in a tweet.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Courseulles-sur-Mer, Anne-Marie Philippeaux, said her government moved to help protect the site to ensure it would be there for future generations.
</P>
<P>
"By purchasing this land in the Juno sector, with the intent to make it available to Canadians, the elected officials of Courseulles-sur-Mer are continuing the commitment of the elected officials who, on Nov. 10, 2001, made land available to the Juno Beach Centre … in honour of all those who served in the Canadian military during the Second World War," she said in a media statement.

$15 goal is 'no longer enough,' says head of Canadian Labour Congress

Canadian workers earning minimum wage in several provinces are now seeing an increase in their paycheques.
</P>
<P>
Six provinces — Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador — hiked their minimum wage effective last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of increases come as the cost of living soars, with Canada's annual inflation rate reaching a nearly 40-year high in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage is now $15.50 in Ontario, $13 in Saskatchewan, $13.50 in Manitoba, $13.60 in Nova Scotia, $13.75 in New Brunswick and $13.70 in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</P>
<P>
Several provinces have additional pay hikes scheduled over the coming months and years, many in a bid to raise minimum wages to $15 an hour — if they haven't already reached that benchmark as is the case in Ontario, Alberta, B.C. and the three territories.
</P>
<P>
Manitoba plans to reach $15 by October 2023; Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador by April 1, 2024 and Saskatchewan by Oct. 1, 2024, according to the websites of each provincial government. 
</P>
<P>
Long overdue
</P>
<P>
Labour advocates say the gains are long overdue.
</P>
<P>
But they say the long-championed goal of a $15 an hour across the country no longer goes far enough to address the affordability crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We've been calling for a $15 an hour minimum wage for so many years now it's no longer enough," said Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It really needs to be $20 an hour or more when we look at inflation and the cost of food and housing."
</P>
<P>
Hailie Tattrie, an organizer with advocacy group Justice for Workers Nova Scotia, described the wage increase as "definitely needed" but echoed that it's "not enough."
</P>
<P>
"We see people struggling across the country," she said. "A little bit of a wage bump is not going to help."
</P>
<P>
Her organization used to be called the Fight for $15. But over the past year and a half the leadership realized that "$15 is just not enough anymore," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business groups say the minimum wage hikes come at a tough time as they struggle to recover from pandemic shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer than half of small businesses are back to normal levels of sales," said Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
"The average small firm has taken on $160,000 in COVID-related debt and their costs have been rising rapidly. Right now any increase in costs for business is really tough to handle."
</P>
<P>
Businesses will likely respond to higher wages by raising prices or reducing operating hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that governments are under pressure to increase minimum wages … but they should be finding other ways to help ease the burden on the business community," Kelly said. "We are urging governments to consider putting a freeze on [employment insurance] premiums."
</P>
<P>
Ted Mallett, director of economic forecasting with the Conference Board of Canada, said minimum wage increases should be automatic to make them more predictable for workers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some advocates have suggested indexing minimum wages to inflation, but he said provinces should consider pegging adult minimum wages to 50 per cent of average incomes.
</P>
<P>
"Typically wages rise faster than inflation, that's why living standards increase. So we suggest indexing [minimum wages] to average incomes instead of price increases … as it would increase earning power more over time."

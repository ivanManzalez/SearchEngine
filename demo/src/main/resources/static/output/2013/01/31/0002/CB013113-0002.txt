About half of Behchoko, N.W.T., was without power for about 12 hours Wednesday in -40 C temperatures, forcing some residents to turn to wood stoves and blankets for warmth.
</P>
<P>
Government buildings were closed and elders from the seniors’ residence were moved to buildings with power.
</P>
<P>
Bob Kelly with the Northwest Territories Power Corporation said a piece of equipment on the power line malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
Isadore Wellin and his family bundled up with blankets to stay warm. They had been doing some repairs on their house and had broken windows that were letting cold air in. 
</P>
<P>
Around midday they were just beginning to install a wood stove to try and warm the house up.
</P>
<P>
Wellin said he was frustrated with the power corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Every time the power goes off, sometimes it’s off for three or four hours. But when it comes to pay our power bill ... they don't deduct some money off. They should deduct some money off because we’re cold for three or four hours."
</P>
<P>
The power corporation said it never guarantees power so it won't be providing any reimbursements and won't pay for any damages.
</P>
<P>
Behchoko Chief Clifford Daniels said he had heard about homes with frozen pipes but said he won't know the extent of damages from the power outage for a few days.

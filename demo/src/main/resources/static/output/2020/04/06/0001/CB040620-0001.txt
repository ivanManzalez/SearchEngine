Nova Scotia removes travel from COVID-19 testing requirements; 
</P>
<P>
Previously, one of the prerequisites for getting swabbed was having travelled recently outside of the province
</P>

<P>
The testing lab that handles all of Nova Scotia's COVID-19 results moved to round-the-clock operations Monday, on the same day the province identified 31 new cases of the virus and removed travel as one of the screening requirements.
</P>
<P>
That brings the provincial total of known cases to 293. Those known cases range in age from under 10 to older than 90.
</P>
<P>
Previously, one of the prerequisites for getting swabbed was having travelled recently outside of the province. To get tested, people will still need to use the province's self-assessment questionnaire and get an appointment.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire now simply asks people if they have a fever greater than 38 C, or if they have a new cough or a cough that's getting worse. If they answer yes to either question, they should phone 811.
</P>
<P>
Nine people are currently in hospital and 64 are listed as recovered.
</P>
<P>
To date, there have been 10,218 negative COVID-19 test results in the province.
</P>
<P>
Applications for workers, small businesses ready on Friday
</P>
<P>
Last week, the province announced $20 million to help self-employed and laid-off workers who do not quality for employment insurance, as well as another $20 million to help small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Premier Stephen McNeil said Monday staff are working to have applications for the province's Worker Emergency Bridge Fund and Small Business Impact Grant up and running by Friday.
</P>
<P>
"People will be working all weekend to process applications to get the money flowing as quickly as possible," McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
The applications will be available online, but were originally supposed to be in place by today.
</P>
<P>
Peak case numbers expected in late April
</P>
<P>
Chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang said Nova Scotia will probably be hitting its peak number of cases toward the end of April.
</P>
<P>
"How big that peak is and how dramatic that peak is all up to us," Strang said.
</P>
<P>
"What it looks like afterwards, you don't just come out of this quickly."
</P>
<P>
He said there will likely be a full eight to 10-week period where case numbers will decline after the peak.
</P>
<P>
'I am frustrated,' says McNeil
</P>
<P>
The province continues to urge Nova Scotians to stay home as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
Strang clarified that police will not be stopping people to ask why they are driving, but he asked people to use common sense when going out on the roads.
</P>
<P>
He said essential trips like going to the pharmacy or out for groceries are OK and people should try to limit those trips to once a week, but people should not be driving for social reasons.
</P>
<P>
McNeil echoed those comments.
</P>
<P>
"While we are still frustrated, and I am frustrated, by those who continue to be reckless with our health by not following public health protocol, I will say the vast majority of Nova Scotians are starting to recognize the importance of self-isolation and the six-foot distance," McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
"But if things persist, particularly at our beaches and other parts, we'll continue to look at what are our options for penalties we can put in place."
</P>
<P>
New measures for long-term care homes
</P>
<P>
Strang said the province has also directed long-term care homes to follow certain measures to prevent COVID-19 from entering the facilities and reducing the spread if someone tests positive.
</P>
<P>
He said the directives to long-term care homes include screening staff and residents at least once a day, and twice if it's feasible.
</P>
<P>
All staff members will be required to take their temperature at the start of their shift, as well as undergo a health screening.
</P>
<P>
Any new admissions to a facility will also require a health screening to ensure someone hasn't been exposed to COVID-19.
</P>
<P>
Strang said the province is also reinforcing practising physical distancing, enhancing cleaning and placing restrictions on visitors.
</P>
<P>
There are also instructions on how to take appropriate testing and identify potential contacts if anyone tests positive.
</P>
<P>
Long-term care homes must also continue to report any respiratory illnesses to public health, even if it's one single case.
</P>
<P>
The directives take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We now feel we need to move this from a guideline that facilities are being asked to do, to make it a clear directive," Strang said.
</P>
<P>
Temporary assessment centres will be established in communities where it is known the virus is present, with the first such centre being set up in Elmsdale, N.S.
</P>
<P>
Two SUVs will also be used as mobile testing centres, with one in the Halifax Regional Municipality and one in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Strang said have started mobile testing where they have the greatest need, but said they are looking to expand testing.
</P>
<P>
Another possible public exposure
</P>
<P>
Public health is also advising people of a potential public exposure to COVID-19 at The Magnolia, a long-term care facility in Enfield, N.S. The possible exposure was on March 11 at a celebration of life.
</P>
<P>
People who were there and have experienced symptoms are asked to call 811.

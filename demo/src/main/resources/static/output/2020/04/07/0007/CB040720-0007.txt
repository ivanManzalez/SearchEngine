PM talks about emergency benefits, potential supply shortages as provinces worry about critical gear

The latest: 
</P>
<P>
Eligible Canadians who lost income because of COVID-19 could start applying Monday for a new emergency benefit program as the government tries to keep people afloat during a pandemic that has claimed thousands of lives worldwide and prompted a frantic scramble to secure critical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said in a statement that delays in global shipments and restrictions at the U.S. border have "severely strained Ontario's inventory" and left Canada's most populous province with "roughly a one-week supply" of critical personal protective equipment (PPE).
</P>
<P>
He told reporters Monday that Ontario has a current order for about four million masks from the U.S. and that only half a million have been released.
</P>
<P>
"We know the U.S. isn't allowing supplies across the border," Ford said. "Getting supplies from other countries is increasingly difficult."
</P>
<P>
WATCH | Ford talks about tight supplies in Ontario:
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside Rideau Cottage, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is in constant contact with the provinces about PPE and other important supplies. The government is also in talks with the U.S., he said, and has reiterated that critical supplies flow both ways across the border.
</P>
<P>
Monday evening, 3M, the company at the centre of the dispute between the U.S. and Canada, released a statement saying it had struck a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to supply N95 masks to other countries, including Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"As the pandemic unfolds in different stages around the world," the company said in a statement, "3M will continue to work with governments to direct respirators and other supplies to serve areas most in need."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called the flow of medical-related supplies across the border "very" reciprocal, adding that members of the government had "positive" conversations with U.S. counterparts over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries benefit from this and both countries would lose out if hurdles were to be put in the way of that flow of health-care support between our two countries," she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CBC News reported Monday that Ontario hospitals have received more than 600 extra ventilators to help treat COVID-19 patients.
</P>
<P>
During his daily news conference, Trudeau spoke at length about the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB), which opened to applications early Monday morning to people born in January, February and March. The system, run through the Canada Revenue Agency, staggers the application window for people born in later months as the week goes on. The employment minister's office said by late Monday afternoon, 642,000 applications had been submitted for the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
WATCH | Trudeau says more Canadians will be able to access emergency benefits:
</P>
<P>
The emergency funding program, which offers eligible applicants $2,000 a month for a period of up to four months, is just one of the measures the Canadian government has launched to try and buoy families and businesses feeling the fallout from the virus, which has to date resulted in nearly 1.3 million reported cases around the world.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau said his government knows not everyone is getting the help they need through CERB and other programs. He said in the days ahead, the government will announce additional measures aimed at helping gig workers, contract workers, and workers who are getting 10 or fewer hours per week. What those measures would be and how they would work was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also talked about measures to help post-secondary students who can't find summer jobs and workers who are still on the job but earning less than they would if they were on the CERB. There were no details on those programs, either.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who don't yet qualify who we need to help," PM says. He says people working less than 10 hours a week will soon qualify for CERB. Or people who are working but are making less than the benefit - the gov't will help them too.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister thanked people performing critical services in the health care, trucking and food sectors, but urged people who don't need to be out to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
"What the next weeks and months look like depends on you," Trudeau said, urging people to take actions to protect the vulnerable and keep the health-care system from being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he couldn't agree more with the government's decision to move forward with a "Team Canada" approach to the outbreak — and said Conservatives have been part of that approach since "Day 1" of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Scheer focused his remarks on the charitable sector, saying that while need is soaring, donations have "dramatically declined." He said Conservatives want the government to temporarily increase the tax credit for charitable giving in 2020, and remove the capital gains tax on charitable donations of private company shares and real estate. He also called on the government to release its coronavirus projections and modelling, as well as further details around how it plans to meet needs for critical medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to a database maintained by Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University, nearly 73,000 people have died as a result of the virus, which was first reported in China's Hubei province in late 2019. The United States reached a grim milestone today, surpassing 10,000 deaths. The true number of COVID-19 cases is certainly much higher due to limited testing, different ways nations count the dead and deliberate under-reporting by some governments.
</P>
<P>
At least 16,667 of the cases are confirmed in Canada, with cases recorded in every province and territory except Nunavut. As of 8:00 p.m. ET on Monday, CBC News has counted a total of 359 deaths in Canada related to COVID-19. The provinces and territories which offer information on people who have recovered listed 3,629 cases as resolved.
</P>
<P>
Public health officials have cautioned that the numbers, which don't include the deaths of two Canadians abroad, don't provide a full picture of the outbreak, as they fail to capture cases that haven't been tested or are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of infected people recover from the virus, formally known as SARS CoV-2, which is spread by microscopic droplets from coughs or sneezes.
</P>
<P>
Chief public health officer weighs in on masks
</P>
<P>
The role masks can play to slow the spread of the disease has been contentious, with some countries requiring people to wear masks when out in public. The U.S. recently announced guidelines recommending people cover their faces while in public, though the president noted he wouldn't be following the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, on Monday said masks can be used to protect others when out in public, though she noted that they have not been proven to protect the person wearing the mask from infection. 
</P>
<P>
Tam — who had in the past said masks aren't necessary for people without symptoms — said the change from previous advice is due to increasing evidence that people with the virus can spread it without knowing they're sick.
</P>
<P>
"Now that more countries have had larger numbers of cases and have analyzed transmission patterns, it is clear that transmission of the virus is happening more often than previously recognized from infected people right before they develop symptoms."
</P>
<P>
On top of that pre-symptomatic transmission, there is also evidence that some people who never show symptoms are able to transmit the virus. Given the "emerging information" around asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, Tam said the special advisory committee on COVID-19 had come to a consensus that "wearing a non-medical mask, even if you have no symptoms, is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain."
</P>
<P>
WATCH | Dr. Tam's updated advice about wearing non-medical masks: 
</P>
<P>
Tam reiterated that medical masks are needed for front-line health workers as the country is in a "critical stage" of the COVID-19 pandemic.
</P>
<P>
For most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause pneumonia and death.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Agency of Canada says risk varies between communities but notes that the illness poses a serious health threat to Canadians and pegs the risk level as high.

Via Rail extends service suspensions
</P>
<P>
Via Rail is extending the suspension of its passenger rail service from Toronto to British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
In a note on the company's website, Via says its route between Toronto and Vancouver, and its run from Prince Rupert on B.C.'s north coast through Prince George to Jasper are suspended until June 1.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations include the planned westbound train due to leave Toronto on May 31 and the eastbound service leaving Vancouver on June 1, as well as all the stops in between.

The U.S. death toll officially surpassed 10,000 on Monday, the third most in the world, according to an ongoing Johns Hopkins tally. That milestone comes after a day of conflicting signs in the country's battle against the novel coronavirus, and debate on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
In what seemed to be good news, New York — the hardest-hit state — on Monday saw a death toll that was "effectively flat" for the second day in a row. At a news conference, Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed cautious optimism in the daily increase of new hospitalizations (358) and new admissions into intensive care (128). 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, physician and member of the White House coronavirus task force Brett Giroir said that Americans can expect this week to be "peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week."
</P>
<P>
Central to that concern is a death rate in the United States that is currently roughly twice that of Spain and Italy, as well as hospitals reporting chaotic shortages of beds, ventilators and protective gear.
</P>
<P>
A Monday report from the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates three out of four U.S. hospitals surveyed are already treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The report also says that hospitals expect to be overwhelmed as cases rocket toward their projected peak.
</P>
<P>
Rural hospitals could be particularly vulnerable because of a limited number of beds and smaller staff, though New York CIty still accounts for almost a third of U.S. coronavirus deaths.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals are responding by improvising their own solutions. Some explored buying face masks from nail salons due to the shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE. Others have been trying to make their own hand sanitizer by blending ultrasound gel with alcohol from local distilleries.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the virus probably won't be wiped out entirely this year, and that unless the world gets it under control, it will "assume a seasonal nature."
</P>
<P>
"We need to be prepared that, since it unlikely will be completely eradicated from the planet, that as we get into next season, we may see the beginning of a resurgence," Fauci said. "That's the reason why we're pushing so hard in getting our preparedness much better than it was."
</P>

The total number of people infected in the U.S. is now over 347,000, while more than 90 per cent of U.S. residents are under some kind of stay-at-home order.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to the ICU Monday after being admitted over the weekend with persistent symptoms of the new coronavirus. A statement from 10 Downing Street said, "Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital. The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary."

Italy reported its lowest daily death toll for more than two weeks on Sunday, as the health minister outlined plans for broader testing and beefed-up health services as part of measures following a future easing of the lockdown.
</P>
<P>
Coronavirus-related fatalities and recorded infections continued to drop on Monday in Spain, although authorities warned of possible distortions by a slower reporting of figures over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The country's health ministry reported 637 new deaths for the previous 24 hours, the lowest fatality toll in 13 days, for a total of over 13,000 since the pandemic hit the country. New recorded infections were also the lowest in two weeks: 4,273, bringing the total of confirmed cases over 135,000. Hospitals are also reporting that the pace of incoming patients to their emergency wards is slowing down, giving a much needed respite to overburdened medical workers.
</P>
<P>
France's coronavirus figures on Monday showed that the increase in fatalities — now at almost 9,000 — sped up again after several days of slowing, while the increase in people needing intensive care continued to slow. The total number of cases, combining hospital and nursing home statistics, increased by 5,171 over the last 24 hours to 98,010, meaning France will likely become the fifth country, after Italy, Spain, the United States and Germany, to cross the 100,000 threshold on Tuesday.

Denmark plans to ease lockdown restrictions next week, reopening schools and day-cares closed since March 11, the country's prime minister said on Monday. The Nordic country was one of the first in Europe to shut down services, though it has seen the number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations and deaths stabilize over the past week.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also says his government aims to start allowing some shops to reopen next week at the beginning of a long, phased return to normal life. Kurz said that the aim is to allow small shops and garden centres to reopen next Tuesday, with a limited number of customers who must wear masks. He said the government hopes to reopen the rest of the shops, as well as hairdressing salons, on May 1. Restaurants and hotels won't be able to open until at least mid-May. Events will remain banned until the end of June.

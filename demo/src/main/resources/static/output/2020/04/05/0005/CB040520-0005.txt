Bus company looks to keep rolling in the face of COVID-19; 
</P>
<P>
'People have an emergency surgery and they're called to Halifax. They have to get home'

Mike Cassidy plans to keep rolling.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy owns Maritime Bus and COVID-19 is hurting his business.
</P>
<P>
Travel within the Maritimes has become increasingly restricted. There are physical distancing guidelines to follow.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces have told residents to avoid any non-essential travel to help limit the spread of COVID-19.
</P>
<P>
Maritime Bus, which normally serves the Maritimes and parts of Quebec, recently posted that services are now limited. Maximum capacity has been reduced to 50 per cent on all vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy says no buses have come close to reaching that number in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are experiencing 20 per cent of our normal ridership this week," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keeping the buses running during pandemic
</P>
<P>
But Cassidy believes it's important to keep his operation running during the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"We know we're essential and your medical appointments [are] a very good example," Cassidy said. "People have an emergency surgery and they're called to Halifax. They have to get home."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Air Canada announced layoffs, which resulted in the cancellation of flights between Halifax and Sydney. WestJet offers a daily flight between the two cities, but several have been cancelled in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said he hopes to keep his service running, even with decreased ridership.
</P>
<P>
"We are not operating seven days a week," he said. "If you fly into Halifax and you have to get to Sydney, we're the only option, perhaps, for you."
</P>
<P>
A number of shuttle services have indicated they have ceased operations due to public health measures.
</P>
<P>
According to a Nova Scotia government spokesperson, the province has not directed shuttles to stop operating, but many have decided to suspend service.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said he will continue to keep his buses on the road, even with reduced ridership, so other workers in essential services can get to where they need to go.

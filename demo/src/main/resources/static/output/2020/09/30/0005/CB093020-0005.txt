Hockey Nova Scotia is looking for suggestions on how to increase diversity and inclusion in the sport.
</P>
<P>
The organization's diversity and inclusion task force is particularly interested in hearing from people in communities that are traditionally underrepresented in hockey.
</P>
<P>
The task force was set up last year after a teenager from the We'koqma'k First Nation in Cape Breton complained he was the victim of racial taunts at a game in Chéticamp.
</P>
<P>
A survey on the Hockey Nova Scotia website invites people to weigh in with their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Dean Smith, the chair of the task force, grew up playing hockey in Whitney Pier. He said the survey is a new approach.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been done before to our knowledge," said Smith, who is Black. "The task force looked around the entire country to find examples that we could follow in designing such a survey."
</P>
<P>
Trying to determine barriers
</P>
<P>
The survey is completely anonymous but respondents are asked what community they're from, so the task force can determine the barriers in different communities. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said people from various communities don't stay with the game, including African-Nova Scotians, Indigenous Nova Scotians, recent immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community.
</P>
<P>
"If this is truly Canada's game, then every Canadian should have an opportunity to play," said Smith.
</P>
<P>
Chester Borden, the executive director of the Whitney Pier Youth Club, said the idea of the survey is great since hockey has traditionally been viewed as a white sport.
</P>
<P>
'Start a discussion"
</P>
<P>
"Now you see some other cultures creeping in, and I think this is a good platform to start a discussion and not just for hockey, but any type of sport," said Borden, who is Black.
</P>
<P>
Borden said growing up he experienced some barriers to playing sports, such as a lack of transportation, that he was able to overcome through the help of others.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of those life skills that I learned through sport, I use in my everyday life, especially my job and my activities that we do here with the kids," said Borden.
</P>
<P>
Smith said there are many reasons why certain groups don't pick up playing sports. He said cost is a big factor, especially when it comes to hockey because it is an expensive sport.
</P>
<P>
Smith said as a coach he hears other reasons from parents.
</P>
<P>
"We hear in exit interviews at the end of our one-year developmental program that the game of hockey, the dressing room isn't always comfortable for a single player of colour, it isn't always comfortable for members of the LGBTQ community," said Smith.
</P>
<P>
The survey is available on Hockey Nova Scotia's website until Nov. 1.

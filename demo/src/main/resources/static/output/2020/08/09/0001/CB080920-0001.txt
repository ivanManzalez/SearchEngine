Nova Scotia's short-term rental registry off to slow start; 
</P>
<P>
Data will eventually be used to assess impact on housing market
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The list of short-term rentals registered with the Nova Scotia government is shorter than expected so far.
</P>
<P>
When the province started preparing to regulate the short-term rental market two years ago, it estimated there were between 2,500 and 3,000 unlicensed short-term rental properties across the province listed on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government passed the Tourist Accomodation Registration Act, which requires the owners of those properties to register their units and pay an annual fee between $50 and $150, based on the number of bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The registry also applies to hotels, motels and any other tourist accommodation that has a roof, rents beds for 28 days or fewer and isn't the host's primary residence.
</P>
<P>
Starting April 1, all accommodations that met the criteria were required to register. But only 542 properties had done so by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Business Minister Geoff MacLellan said his department had always intended on taking a "slow walk" toward a complete registry, but the early numbers are "much lower" than he anticipated.
</P>
<P>
MacLellan attributed the sluggish start to COVID-19, which has wreaked havoc on the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the short-term rental registry dropped down the priority list almost as soon as it came into existence. The province quickly paused its plans for an information campaign.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of work to do to get everyone up to date on the regulations and the importance of registering under the new program," he said.
</P>
<P>
MacLellan said he would wait for the industry to stabilize before returning his department's attention to the short-term rental registry.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussion, it's more about … surviving through this disastrous tourism season," he said.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia said it's already been "very active" in sharing information about the registry with its members.
</P>
<P>
The registration fee is waived for the first year, which leaves businesses no excuse, according to TIANS.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage consumers to ensure they are staying at registered properties," a spokesperson for the association said in an email.
</P>
<P>
Impacts on housing
</P>
<P>
When the province introduced the idea of the registry, MacLellan said it was meant to "level the playing field" for all tourism operators.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he said the data would help his colleagues at Housing Nova Scotia determine the impact of short-term rentals on the rental housing market.
</P>
<P>
That impact has been closely watched in some parts of the South Shore, where affordable housing availability has dwindled while short-term rental availability has risen.
</P>
<P>
Rachel Bailey, mayor of the town of Lunenburg, called short-term rentals a "significant disruptor" in her town.
</P>
<P>
"Of primary concern is the negative impact it has had on the availability of long term housing," Bailey said in an email.
</P>
<P>
She said the "appropriate response is still a work in progress for us."
</P>
<P>
Kira Curtis, who lives in Riverport and owns a restaurant in Mahone Bay, said she's well aware of the pressure short-term rentals are putting on housing in her community. She said she's aware because she recruits staff from out of town and out of province, and they often have a hard time finding a place to live.
</P>
<P>
She said she has grappled with her complicity in the issue because, in addition to running Mateus Bistro, she owns a small property in town that she lists on Airbnb.
</P>
<P>
"My solace in me listing that is … it's not able to be rented year-round and it's a very small little place," she said.
</P>
<P>
Curtis said she doesn't think she's competing with the long-term rental housing market because the bachelor-style loft space she rents out is only habitable in the summer months, and she doesn't believe she's competing with conventional B&Bs and hotels in the area because she doesn't offer the same amenities.
</P>
<P>
Still, Curtis's property does qualify for the new provincial registry, but she isn't among the 542 operators who have registered. She hadn't heard about it until CBC contacted her.
</P>
<P>
"I did not know it existed … I suppose I'll give them the, you know, it's a chaotic year. So that story could easily have gotten lost. I think it's important. I wish I would have known or [had] a letter sent out," said Curtis.
</P>
<P>
The value of the registry
</P>
<P>
Lisa Ryan, the rural housing development co-ordinator for a non-profit-led housing support program in Lunenburg and Queens counties, is eager to see the data the province collects through the registry.
</P>
<P>
She said the long-term rental market in the area is "almost non-existent" right now, and "concrete and current data" will help the community find solutions.
</P>
<P>
"I think [the registry] is an excellent way for the government to kind of get an idea of how many short-term rentals are within our area and how they'll be regulated," Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
She said it's imperative to find solutions that work both for the housing sector and the tourism industry, which is an important part of the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our communities, especially along the South Shore, do rely on the tourism industry to bring income for jobs, but I think the struggle that most employers are seeing is they can't have employees work their jobs if they can't find housing for their employees."
</P>
<P>
Ryan said she's also "very intrigued" to see what the registry reveals about where money spent on short-term rentals is going.
</P>
<P>
"I think this will be very telling to find out exactly how many of these short-term rentals are locally owned and how many are owned by companies outside of Nova Scotia."
</P>
<P>
Ryan said she hopes the province takes the penalties for not registering seriously. Operators who don't register can face a fine of up to $1,000 per day to an annual maximum of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
The province has not issued any fines yet and says it won't until the "education phase" is over. MacLellan said there's no timeline for that.

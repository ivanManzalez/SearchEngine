In the Halifax region, the Nova Scotia SPCA has launched a free pilot project called Paws & Support. While they're with the SPCA, owned pets will receive veterinary care and live with trained temporary foster families. Once an owner is in a healthy, safe space, they will be reunited with their pet.

Police supports
</P>
<P>
Nova Scotia RCMP have a victim services program to support victims of all crime types including intimate partner violence. The victim services volunteers are trained to support, give information and make referrals for community resources, according to RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Jennifer Clarke.
</P>
<P>
If an intimate partner violence file is considered a high risk for reoffence, they are managed by six high-risk case co-ordinators in Nova Scotia. Four are with the RCMP, one is with Cape Breton Regional Police, and one is with Halifax Regional Police.
</P>
<P>
Within the RCMP, Clarke said their case co-ordinators work with service providers like transition homes, corrections, family services and men's treatment programs. Safety planning is updated when new information is received, including case conferences with the victim and the service providers.
</P>
<P>
Cases that are not high risk are handled by RCMP victim services volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Halifax Regional Police also have a domestic violence officer (DVO), who is trained in a trauma-informed approach and is knowledgeable of the complexities of domestic violence, said spokesperson Const. John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
This officer focuses on domestic violence cases where there is a high risk to reoffend, and can connect the offender to the domestic violence navigator program, which was established to help offenders who "want to make changes in their lives and heal their relationships with family and loved ones," and provide support, co-ordinate cases and assist with referrals to service providers.
</P>
<P>
Intervention programs
</P>
<P>
There are various counselling programs available throughout the province for men who have been violent in their relationships or affected by abuse, as well as women.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Domestic violence leave
</P>
<P>
Nova Scotia offers partially paid leave for those experiencing domestic violence. An employee who has worked for their employer for at least three months can take up to 10 intermittent or consecutive days per year, or up to 16 consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence leave can be used to seek medical attention, receive counselling, obtain victim services support, or seek legal or law enforcement assistance.
</P>
<P>
People can apply for paid leave by giving written notice to their employer and providing them the anticipated start and end date of the leave. The employer may also request an application through the Labour Standards Division.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence court
</P>
<P>
All provinces and territories have established domestic violence courts so that the justice system can improve its response to abuse, provide better support to victims and make offenders more accountable, according to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
In Nova Scotia, there are courts in both Sydney and Halifax where those 18 and older can attend. The program allows for the input of people who have been affected by the abuse and programming options to help address the violence.
</P>
<P>
To participate, the person charged with domestic violence must be willing to accept responsibility for their actions. Generally, this means entering a guilty plea. If the offender has completed their rehabilitation plan by the end of the process, the designated judge sentences the individual, taking into account their participation.
</P>
<P>
Victims are not required to meet with their abusive partner in this program, since no one single approach fits everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The program strives to be flexible and responsive to people's needs, what is necessary for them to be safe, to achieve just outcomes and for offenders to be accountable for their behaviour," according to the Courts of Nova Scotia website.
</P>
<P>

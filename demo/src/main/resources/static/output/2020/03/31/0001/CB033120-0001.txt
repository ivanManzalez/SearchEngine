Two Cape Breton boys are busting their boredom by making online newscasts.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Liam Sakalauskas, 11, and Lucas Sakalauskas, 9, of Sydney River, launched the first of what they hope will be weekly Friday newscasts on their YouTube channel.
</P>
<P>
On their first newscast, dramatic music played as Liam greeted his audience from behind a desk to talk about COVID-19, while Lucas joined in to talk weather and science, playing the role of both meteorologist and science reporter. A graphic reading "East Coast Kids News" flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
The idea came in part from their dad, Herbie Sakalauskas, who is the video production specialist at Cape Breton University.
</P>
<P>
"It was excellent for them to get some learning and get back to a bit of a routine after March Break," Herbie Sakalauskas told CBC's Information Morning Cape Breton.

<P>
Students in Nova Scotia originally had their March Breaks extended by two weeks because of COVID-19. However, on Monday the province announced schools won't reopen until at least May 4.

The boys were involved in all stages of video production, from research to setting up a green screen. They even used a teleprompter app to read the script.
</P>
<P>
"It's awesome for me to see because I'm bringing my everyday world into their world and it's really cool to see," said Herbie.
</P>
<P>
The brothers also like working with their dad.
</P>
<P>
"Our dad is such an amazing dad, we're so glad that he can do that," said Liam.
</P>
<P>
The video has been getting a lot of traction from friends and family, much to the delight of the boys.
</P>
<P>
"Our music teacher, she saw it and she asked me if she could post it and then a bunch of our family has seen it and they've been commenting, lots of nice things," said Lucas.

A new online app is helping Nova Scotians write living wills amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Jocelyn Downie, a professor at Dalhousie's Schulich School of Law, started developing the app with the Legal Information Society of Nova Scotia last year.
</P>
<P>
But Downie says the app is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't anticipating this pandemic at all," Downey told CBC's Information Morning on Friday. "It is just incredibly fortuitous that we have it ready now."
</P>
<P>
A living will, or personal directive, is a legal document that helps family members and health-care providers make decisions when a person is left incompetent from injury or illness.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, 90 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, 55 people have died from the virus as of Saturday. Infection can lead to death but most people don't experience severe illness, according to the Nova Scotia government.
</P>
<P>
But Downie said it's still important to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
"People don't think, 'Oh, I need this,' and yet everybody from 18 up should have a personal directive because [it's] not just the coronavirus situation, you might get hit by a car," she said.
</P>
<P>
Personal directives identify who a person wants to be their delegate if they can no longer make their own decisions. The document can also state instructions, wishes, values and beliefs about personal care.
</P>
<P>
First of its kind in Canada
</P>
<P>
Downie said the app is the first of its kind in Canada — and is specific to Nova Scotia legislation to prevent invalid documents.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people have personal directives that are very unclear and they're not helpful to the clinicians who are trying to figure out what it is this person wanted," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nova Scotians can fill out a personal directive online from their own home. Once the application is submitted, the document is valid and can be printed or emailed.
</P>
<P>
Downie said personal directives are not common in Nova Scotia but it's best to be prepared, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"Bad things can happen and you [might be] unable to speak for yourself, so everyone should have one, but right now it's particularly acute."

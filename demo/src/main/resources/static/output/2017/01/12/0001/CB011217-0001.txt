Dragon boats are a familiar sight at Mooney's Bay in the summer but this year Ottawa will be hosting a brand new festival at Dow's Lake — in the middle of winter.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Ottawa Ice Dragon Boat Festival is a highlight of the Canada 150 edition of Winterlude. The lineup of activities for this year's festival, which runs from Feb. 3 to 20, is set to be officially unveiled this morning at the Canadian Museum of Nature.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Ottawa Ice Dragon Boat Festival opened a second block to meet demand, after the first round of registration sold out in just 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It's the first event of its kind in North America, and has drawn athletes to register from as far as California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
Paddles are equipped with spikes to drag the boats along the ice.
</P>
<P>
The races are scheduled for February 17 and 18 at Dow's Lake.

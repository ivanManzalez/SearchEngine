Montrealers can now hit the slopes closer to home with new Ville-Émard sports hill;

Montreal's ski and snowboard enthusiasts might not have to travel quite as far to get their snow fix this winter.
</P>
<P>
It's all thanks to La Pente à Neige, an non-profit organization that's opened a winter sports hill about a 10-minute walk from Angrignon Metro, at Ignace-Bourget Park.
</P>
<P>
The hill has been in the works for a couple years and toboggan slope is free.
</P>
<P>
However, there are fees for the tubing slope and lessons for skiing and snowboarding. There are discounts for residents of the Southwest borough — and those with a lower income.
</P>
<P>
"We have policies to ensure that everybody can access the activities that we have on site," said spokesperson Andrew Borrelli.
</P>
<P>
If you live in the Southwest, you get 15 per cent off the regular price.
</P>
<P>
Lower-income patrons get up to 50 per cent off, depending on the number of people in the family and their income.
</P>
<P>
Getting active in the winter
</P>
<P>
The slope is split into three sections for now — one for skiing and snowboarding, one for snow-tubing, and one for traditional tobogganing.
</P>
<P>
The organization's goal is to offer accessible winter activities, especially for Montreal's "more vulnerable populations," Borrelli said.
</P>
<P>
"We know very well winter can be tough, the cold weather can make us want to stay inside a bit more, so that makes us more socially isolated," he said.
</P>
<P>
La Pente à Neige offers ski and snowboarding lessons for beginners who are four and five years old. They also provide ski and snowboard gear for anyone hoping to give the small slope a try.
</P>
<P>
Cold won't stop snow-lovers
</P>
<P>
On Friday, when the temperature hovered around -20 C, families gathered at Ignace-Bourget for the site's opening day.
</P>
<P>
"It's really fun. It's accessible, and it's cool," said Kathy Fontaine, who lives in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine spent her afternoon snow-tubing down a snowy slope. She said she thinks it would be a great place for her son to learn to snowboard — something he's wanted to do for a long time.
</P>
<P>
For Luc Bessette, who was at the slopes with his daughter, the day couldn't get much better.
</P>
<P>
"I like it because it brings the kids out more," Bessette said. "Hopefully this will bring more kids out."
</P>
<P>
Plans for the future
</P>
<P>
Though the organization's members are very excited that their project has finally come to life, they hope this will only be the beginning.
</P>
<P>
"In the long-term we'd like to see parks like this exist in parks across the city," Borrelli said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that even putting the site up this winter has been a lot of hard work.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to put a snowboard park in place for people who want to shred the gnar, winter style.

The Vancouver Police Department has launched a new safety campaign aimed at those looking for love online.
</P>
<P>
"We've compiled tips on catchyou.ca, that offer information on how users can reduce the likelihood they will become victims of assault or fraud," said Const. Anne-Marie Clark. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, police say they've seen an increase in the number of sexual assault reports that were initiated through online dating or social media. 
</P>
<P>
"He may sound like your soulmate but he is still a stranger," said Det.-Const. Michelle Grandbois. 
</P>
<P>
"Take control of your safety online and reduce the chances of meeting somebody that is nothing like you were expecting," she said.
</P>
<P>
Grandbois said no particular web site is worse or safer than any other.

'Women at higher risk' 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly on dating sites, women, are finding themselves at higher risk of sexual assault, violent crimes and fraud," said Grandbois.
</P>
<P>
She was also quick to point out that these crimes were not the fault of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never call it a mistake that a women makes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a legitimate thing. Lots of people meet online, on dating sites, and it's unfortunate predators have found this out, and it's a perfect platform for them to look through and basically select potential victims," she said.
</P>
<P>
The VPD said it has a strong suspicion these crimes are being under-reported and says it's why it launched the campaign on Wednesday, urging victims to come forward.
</P>
<P>
"It's never too late to report any crime to the police," said Grandbois.
</P>
<P>
"We want to hear from victims, so they can access the resources and help prevent others from being victimized," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't help what we don't know ...  please come forward and report to police."

The City of Montreal has unveiled a plan to build a new public square that will be used as an urban terrasse in the summer and a skating rink in the winter.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-square-metre space on Clark Street between Ste-Catherine Street and de Maisonneuve Boulevard  is situated right next to Place des Arts and the Quartier des Spectacles.
</P>
<P>
The $67-million project will see the currently empty lot turned into a shared space with food stands, a pavilion housing a restaurant and changing rooms and green space where temporary stages can be set up.
</P>
<P>
The work is expected to be completed by 2019, and will also involve the reconstruction of Clark Street.

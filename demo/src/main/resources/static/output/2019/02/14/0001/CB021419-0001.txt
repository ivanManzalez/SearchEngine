The federal government is putting $20 million toward a new program meant to reduce reliance on diesel power in remote Indigenous communities in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi made the announcement in Whitehorse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Through this program, we want to build a capacity of the communities to find local solutions that work for them instead of solutions that might be imposed by external organizations," Sohi said.
</P>
<P>
A panel of Indigenous jurors will select up to 15 communities across Canada. Those communities will each receive up to $1.3 million to develop their local plan for over three years.
</P>
<P>
Sohi says there are more 200 communities across Canada that apply for the funding because they rely on diesel power generation.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that diesel has a significant impact on the environment for the creation of greenhouse gas emissions, but diesel also has health impacts," said Sohi.

<P>
Blair Hogan, president of Whitehorse-based Gunta Business Consulting, was a guest speaker at the announcement on Wednesday. His company has been involved in the Teslin Tlingit Council's biomass heating plant which received federal funding in 2017.
</P>
<P>
"What about communities like Watson Lake, what about communities like Ross River? Those are the types of communities that really need to have some more of this support," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It helps move those communities forward, and all the other communities across Canada that just have that need but haven't had that ability."
</P>
<P>
The federal government says the new program is in addition to $700 million already committed to help rural and remote communities get off diesel.

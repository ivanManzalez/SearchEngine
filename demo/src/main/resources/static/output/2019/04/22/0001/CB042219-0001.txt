Workers in the fossil fuel industry are concerned that jobs in new green industries won't offer the same pay and benefits, according to a union president.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a job there … that'll meet the equivalent of what we have now," said Roy Milne, a coal miner and president of United Steelworkers Local 1595 in Wabamun, Alta.
</P>
<P>
Milne is part of "the first group of workers in the first mine being phased out in Canada."
</P>
<P>
He told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that a basic operator earns $80,000-$100,000 per year, with additional benefits and a defined pension scheme.
</P>
<P>
An electrician retraining as a renewable energy technician would go from that salary to $45,000-$50,000 per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With a year's training, you can make half the money and get no benefits."
</P>

In 2016, the federal government announced a plan to eliminate the use of traditional coal-fired electricity by 2030 — which could affect approximately 42,000 people directly and indirectly employed by the coal industry, according to the Coal Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
One activist is calling for the creation of a million climate jobs to replace those lost in fossil fuels, and he wants the government's help.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a combination of federal, provincial, and municipal governments coming into it," said Bruno Dobrusin, campaign co-ordinator with the Green Economy Network, a coalition of labour, environment and social justice groups pushing for a new green economy.
</P>
<P>
He told Tremonti that the financing would have to come from the public purse, but noted that money is already going to support the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
"Part of our plan is saying: 'Let's divest part of those subsidies that go now to fossil fuels, and put them in massive scale towards this new economy.'"
</P>
<P>
You need 'meat on the bones of a plan'
</P>
<P>
A million new jobs is an excellent goal, Milne said, but there needs to be training provided, and compensation should measure up to the jobs people are losing.
</P>
<P>
Dobrusin agreed that green industries cannot be let "off the hook."
</P>
<P>
"They have to pay good salaries, they have to get a unionized workforce," he told Tremonti.
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious issue for a worker that has been there for 20 or 30 years, doing the job at that level of pay, and that now has to transition into something else."
</P>
<P>
Milne spoke to The Current from COP24, the UN's global climate change talks in Katowice, Poland. He's seen a lot of good intentions at the talks, he said, but "you have to have meat on the bones of a plan."
</P>
<P>
"Just to have lots of plans and say this will be all wonderful, doesn't work when you get your pink slip and you still have a mortgage and kids to feed."

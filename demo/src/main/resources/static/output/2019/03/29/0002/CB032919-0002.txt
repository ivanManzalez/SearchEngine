'Nest of lies': Edmontonians get scammed twice by online syndicates; 
</P>

'If it is too good to be true, it probably is'

Police are warning Edmontonians to be wary of a new kind of financial fraud that targets people who have previously fallen prey to online romance scams.
</P>
<P>
Local victims have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to intricate online scams orchestrated by criminal syndicates, police said in a news release Friday.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton police describe the schemes as "scam nests." 
</P>
<P>
"Scammers create an intricate and detailed illusion, which is why victims believe it is real," police said. "It is extremely well done."
</P>
<P>
In these new scams, victims who have been previously defrauded are offered help to deal with the financial loss by consolidating their debt, for a fee.
</P>
<P>
'Money-making business' 
</P>
<P>
The scams can also involve fake inheritance settlements, police said. In those cases, online "loved ones" will promise to transfer their inheritance to victims, for a fee. The victims are then connected with a lawyer who sets up transfers, providing the victim with fake banking documentation.
</P>
<P>
The victim is then charged exorbitant fees for processing and tax payments to either the CRA or the IRS.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fairly sophisticated fraud where "faker makers" are hired to craft a very plausible scenario for victims to fall for," Det. Linda Herczeg said in a statement. "So many people are involved to create this nest of lies, but it's their money-making business.
</P>
<P>
"They have no issues with taking as much money and information as they can convince you to give."
</P>
<P>
"Faker makers" are integral to facilitating online frauds, police said. The fraudsters typically belong to a scam syndicate or may be servicing multiple syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The boss of the syndicate creates a series of fake entities for a scammer to use, including fake profiles for lawyers, federal tax agents and banks. They also create fraudulent, authentic-looking internet sites to trick their victims, police said.  
</P>
<P>
People can protect themselves by doing research, police said. Confirm online organizations are legitimate and be cautious of any transactions with internet strangers.
</P>
<P>
"If it is too good to be true, it probably is," police said.

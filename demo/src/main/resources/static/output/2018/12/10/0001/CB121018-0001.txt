A company with roots in Fort Providence says its energy system could slash costs in northern communities by as much as 60 per cent while cutting harmful carbon emissions.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Philipp of SSi Energy, a division of the Northwest Territories telecommunications company SSi Micro, presented his combined heat-and-power system to a committee of MLAs at the Legislative Assembly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a basic level, the "SSi Energy Solution" system would capture heat waste created through the production of power and repurpose it to warm homes, water and buildings.
</P>
<P>
The captured heat would be stored in thermal batteries at a central location and redistributed through a network of underground, insulated pipes.
</P>
<P>
Capturing wasted energy
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar could also be tied into the system.
</P>
<P>
Right now, said Philipp, about two-thirds of the fuel used in power generation is expelled as noise, friction and heat. He said capturing that energy could cut a community's fuel consumption in half.
</P>
<P>
"This is not like I've solved some gigantic problem that nobody else has solved," Philipp told the territory's standing committee on economic development and environment.
</P>
<P>
"This is adapting technologies that maybe nobody else has heard of to a very well-known problem and solution."
</P>
<P>
Philipp's concept is based on the off-grid energy system used to power buildings on 77,000 square feet of land in Fort Providence, including the Snowshoe Inn, which was founded by Philipp's parents.
</P>
<P>
"We've been off-grid 50 years," said Philipp.
</P>
<P>
"We understand this problem extremely well and this solution will reduce the total cost of energy in these communities by no less than 50 per cent."
</P>
<P>
Meet the graphene supercapacitor
</P>
<P>
A standout component of Philipp's concept is the graphene supercapacitor, an energy storage unit that charges and discharges energy faster than regular batteries.
</P>
<P>
"Graphene will be the next major revolution much like the industrial or the telecommunications revolution. Graphene is no less important than that," said Philipp.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of graphene are many, he said. Graphene batteries function at temperatures as low as -30 C, they charge quickly, have a longer lifespan, and don't use chemicals, which makes them easier to dispose.
</P>
<P>
MLAs on Friday were pleased by the presentation. Frame Lake MLA Kevin O'Reilly called it "music to my ears."
</P>
<P>
Philipp wouldn't disclose the estimated startup costs for his energy system, but said the initial investment would produce long-term gains.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident that the return on the investment is 20 per cent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lower energy costs could have other residual benefits for a community, added Philipp, such as reducing the costs of housing and running a business.

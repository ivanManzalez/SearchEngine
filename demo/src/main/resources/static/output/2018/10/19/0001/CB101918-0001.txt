Debate and disagreement will be inevitable at city hall next week as council considers its capital budget for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $4.3-billion capital budget released Thursday shows the city plans to spend almost half — about 45 per cent — of it on neighbourhood renewal.
</P>
<P>
The remainder is dedicated to new infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Some of the big projects being funded between 2019 and 2022 include the conversion of Yellowhead Trail into a freeway, the Valley Line Southeast LRT, the development of the Blatchford neighbourhood and upgrading Fort Edmonton Park.
</P>
<P>
But there's a long list — nearly 100 other projects — that have been requested but the finance department is recommending the city doesn't fund. 
</P>
<P>
The projects include recreation, transit, roads, parks and sports fields. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don Iveson has said it will be a tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest choices we're going to have are on our growth projects, How much and how fast can we attack the challenge of the Terwillegar?" he said Thursday at a media availability. "Do we have capacity for some of the other infrastructure projects that are needed because of growth?"
</P>
<P>
Nine projects could go forward but only if the city borrows and incurs debt, the report says. They include the much-anticipated Lewis Farms Recreation Centre and Library, upgrades to the LRT Stadium Station and the Terwillegar Drive Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The budget report describes the Yellowhead Trail as a project of "national significance" as it's part of the Trans-Canada Highway.
</P>
<P>
The city budgeted $281 million toward the estimated $1 billion project. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Line West and Metro Line extensions are also getting a design budget of $56 million.
</P>
<P>
The city's capital budget allots $115 million toward developing the former city centre airport into what will be the Blatchford neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
Iveson took direct aim at the province's withdrawal from a grant program called Municipal Sustainability Initiative, which cities and towns use for long-term planning of capital projects.
</P>
<P>
The province is reducing MSI grants by $61 million per year over the next three years and ending the program altogether at the end of 2021.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to replace the MSI with a grant program based on revenue-sharing with municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Iveson has been asking the province for more details since the announcement was made in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated again this week with where we're at," Iveson said. "The City of Edmonton operates in an environment of ever-present financial uncertainty around the security and stability of provincial and federal capital grants."
</P>
<P>
The budget will be presented to city council on Tuesday.

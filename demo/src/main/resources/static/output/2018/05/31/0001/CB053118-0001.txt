Experts in green energy heating are meeting with the Cape Breton Regional Municipality this week to discuss the potential for a district system for downtown Sydney, N.S.
</P>
<P>
"It would be cheaper than what we are doing now and is particularly beneficial to Sydney where there is no natural gas available," said David Brushett, a manager with Efficiency Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Efficiency Nova Scotia is partnering with CBRM, along with Enwave Energy Corporation, a North American leader in sustainable energy services.
</P>
<P>
Enwave generally operates in larger municipalities, said Brushett. "So it is very exciting and innovative."

Sydney's downtown district sees new life
</P>
<P>
A $7.5M redesign is in the works for downtown Sydney
</P>
<P>
He said the cheaper heat would be great for revitalizing the downtown and encouraging future development.
</P>
<P>
Options include geothermal heat from water in the harbour, recovering heat from sewage and using bio-gas from the waste treatment plant to produce heat.
</P>
<P>
Brushett said an exchange system could recover heat from a sewage main near Centre 200. It could be used to heat water for buildings.
</P>
<P>
A similar system using underwater pipes could extract heat from the harbour. As well, bio-gas from the waste water treatment plant could be put to use.
</P>
<P>
Halifax already using geothermal
</P>
<P>
There are already a number of buildings in Halifax using the harbour as a source of heat, including Purdy's Wharf and Nova Scotia Power's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Brushett said a study will be completed by the end of the summer. At that point, Enwave will decide if it wants to build and operate a system.
</P>
<P>
"So the cost will be completely paid for by the private company," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downtown building owners could then decide whether to convert their heating systems and buy from Enwave.

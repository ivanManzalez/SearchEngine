<P>
The city of Edmonton is crafting a new plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
</P>
<P>
The urban planning committee, made up of several councillors, agreed to one of three scenarios presented Tuesday by city staff — to cut GHGs in half by that year. 
</P>
<P>
Two other scenarios introduced by staff suggested cutting GHGs by 30 per cent or setting a full carbon-neutral target by the same year.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the middle option is the best and that cutting GHGs by 50 per cent would require an investment of $67 million over the next three years but would save $76 million within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don Iveson said making the city's more than 900 buildings more energy efficient will mean lower utility bills in the end.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the city to purchase 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 — solar, wind, biomass and hydro.
</P>
<P>
Coun. Jon Dziadyk doesn't think the city should own green electricity, calling the scenario "an aggressive target full of risk and increased expenses to taxpayers."
</P>
<P>
He said the city should focus on rehabilitating older buildings and switching to LED bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
"We will make significant strides in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions with a balanced approach," Dziadyk said. 
</P>
<P>
David Dodge, a co-chair with the city's energy transition advisory committee, said green electricity is the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Coun. Michael Walters agreed that paying now will save in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't pay here, we're going to pay there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iveson wants to make sure Edmonton uses as many local sources as possible when buying renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to buy it from B.C. right now."
</P>
<P>
Staff are expected to return on June 18 with a report on how wind power could be used in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
Council will need to approve funding for the plan in the 2019-2022 budget, up for debate this fall.

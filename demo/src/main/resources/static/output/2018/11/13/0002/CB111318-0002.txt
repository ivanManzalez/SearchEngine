Calgary city council has approved a village of tiny homes for homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
The Homes for Heroes village will open in Forest Lawn in southeast Calgary in the spring of 2019 at the corner of 36th Street and Eighth Avenue S.E.    
</P>
<P>
David Howard, president and co-founder of the Homes for Heroes Foundation, is spearheading the project.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled, I'm emotional, quite frankly. This is something we've been working at for two and a half years," he said.
</P>
<P>
1st tiny home village for homeless veterans in Canada to open in Calgary next year
</P>
<P>
"So, we walked into council, very hopeful to get a unanimous decision to move forward to build our first in Calgary. It's just an incredible thing, right after Remembrance Day."
</P>
<P>
ATCO took care of the design and construction, and will take care of the delivery and placement of the 275-square foot homes, and the Mustard Seed is selecting suitable tenants for the village.
</P>
<P>
Last month, ATCO showed off the first of the tiny homes the company is building for the Homes for Heroes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
They're fully equipped with a kitchen, a three-piece bathroom and a living room that doubles as a bedroom with a Murphy-bed.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to start moving veterans into the units late next spring. The village will have 15 homes, a resource centre, community gardens and memorials to Canadian soldiers who lost their lives in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The homes will be grouped as a village to create a community of peers.
</P>
<P>
Howard says his foundation is working to replicate the Homes for Heroes village model in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
"We want to build two in every major municipality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa estimates there are about 2,600 homeless veterans across Canada, but Howard says the true number is likely substantially higher.
</P>
<P>
"This is a transitional program. So the idea is they're coming in, working on self, working in that peer-to-peer program, with their buddies, I've got your back, I've got your six. And then moving on from there and becoming a mentor for the next one to come in," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So we believe that we have a solution that we can take across Canada to end homelessness among our veteran population."

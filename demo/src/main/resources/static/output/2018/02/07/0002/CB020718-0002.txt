Even before it's up and running, the City of Yellowknife has won a sustainability award for its plan to reduce the city's emissions with new wood pellet boilers.
</P>
<P>
Yellowknife was recently awarded the 2018 Sustainable Communities Award in the energy category from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities — recognizing environmental initiatives in the community.
</P>
<P>
Instead of using fossil fuels, the city will use the wood pellet system to heat five buildings — the multiplex, fieldhouse public works garage, city warehouse and firehall. It will be the biggest pellet heating system in the Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
The wood pellet boiler — also called the biomass district energy system —  is expected to reduce fuel costs up to $160,000 each year, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 829 tonnes annually, according to a city news release.
</P>
<P>
The city will spend close to $2 million to implement the new system.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to see even more savings, in terms of financial savings, from the increased efficiency," said Mike Auge, manager of sustainability and solid waste for the city.
</P>
<P>
The project was delayed because of delays in shipments from Europe, said Auge.
</P>
<P>
The system is expected to start operating in March.

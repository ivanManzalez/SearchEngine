A Maple Ridge, B.C., man has been charged with faking relationships to steal thousands from a number of people — and RCMP say there may be more victims.

Reza Moeinian, 37, allegedly dated victims for months to gain their trust and build "a deep romantic" bond under a fake name and a fake title as a foreign businessman.

<P>
He's accused of signing victims up for credit cards and lines of credit once he had their trust, only to completely drain them for himself.
</P>
<P>
Moeinian has been charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, one count of theft over $5,000 and one count of causing someone to use a forged document.

<P>
The Los Angeles suspect in a fatal "swatting" incident in the United States has been charged by Calgary police for a similar, but non-fatal, hoax.
</P>
<P>
Swatting is when a call is made to police claiming that a major incident, often involving hostages, is unfolding at a residence and usually results in a tactical team being deployed. 
</P>
<P>
The incident in Calgary took place Dec. 22. A man called 911 and claimed that he had shot his father and was holding his mother and younger brother hostage, according to a police news release. 
</P>
<P>
"While officers were on scene trying to confirm the reported information, Calgary 911 received another call from a female who lived at the address, who believed she was the victim of a swatting call," reads the release. 
</P>
<P>
"The female exited her residence and officers confirmed that the initial report of a shooting and hostage scenario was false."
</P>
<P>
Kansas shooting
</P>
<P>
Police say the woman may have been targeted because of her online persona. Investigators identified a suspect who had made contact with her earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Raj Barriss, 25, has been charged with public mischief, fraud and mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Duty Insp. Peter Siegenthaler said swatting calls can put the public and officers at risk and tie up police resources.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take these calls seriously and we have to take them at face value based on the information that we receive."
</P>
<P>
Siegenthaler said the Dec. 22 call concerned police because it was very specific and sounded very real.
</P>
<P>
He said it's not difficult for someone to figure out how to make a 911 call to a different city.
</P>
<P>
Barriss is currently in custody in Los Angeles awaiting a handover to Kansas to stand trial for a fatal incident on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Wichita police responded to a home after a man called 911 and said he had shot his father, was holding a gun to his mother and sister and had doused the home in gasoline and was considering setting it alight. 
</P>
<P>
Once police arrived, a man, later identified as 28-year-old Andrew Finch, emerged from the house and an officer shot him dead. Finch was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said Finch was shot after he raised his hands quickly and appeared to point a weapon at officers. 
</P>
<P>
It seems unlikely Barriss will ever see the inside of a Calgary courtroom. Siegenthaler said Barriss likely won't be extradited to Canada to face charges. But Barriss would be arrested if he entered the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Barriss wasn't on the Calgary Police Service's radar until after the incident in Wichita.

'World class' green neighbourhood steams ahead at Blatchford; 
</P>
<P>
Carbon-neutral development would use heat from sewer lines

Plans for a 100-per-cent renewable energy neighbourhood on the site of the old municipal airport in Edmonton took a leap forward Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee recommends $19.4 million be used for Stage 1 of the project's utility infrastructure needs.
</P>
<P>
The city will also retain control over the utilities for the neighbourhood which is expected to house 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"It leaves us the most options, which I think has served us well when we've kept doors open rather than closed doors moving through this process," said Mayor Don Iveson. "That's allowed us to be more creative."
</P>
<P>
The district energy sharing system at Blatchford will have three main features: energy exchange between buildings, shallow geo-exchange wells that store thermal energy in the summer for use in the winter, and recovery of heat from the sewer lines that run beneath the project.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a world-class development," said David Dodge, co-chair of the city's energy transition advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes the flexibility to include some passive homes, which are super-insulated and require only 10 per cent of the heating of a standard home.
</P>
<P>
"You can heat a passive house with two hair dryers — 2,000 watts," Dodge said.
</P>
<P>
Blatchford could also include net-zero homes, which produce as much energy as they consume.
</P>
<P>
"People find energy independence to be a very appealing thing so I have a feeling that will do well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Project will be 'self-funding'
</P>
<P>
Iveson said the project will pay for itself over time and won't need support from taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
"The City of Edmonton is essentially going to float the $19 million or so that it's going to take to build ... Phase 1 of the utility system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We fully expect that will be recovered either by utility fees ... if we're running the utility or we may sell it holus-bolus to our utility partner who will then recover that cost through utility fees.
</P>
<P>
"The intent for this is to be self-funding over time."
</P>
<P>
If city council approves the $19.4 million, the city will begin looking for a utility partner to help build the district energy-sharing system.
</P>
<P>
"We've already had eight different firms express interest in working on this with the city," Iveson said.
</P>
<P>
Iveson expects lots on Blatchford could be sold as early as 2017, with occupancy possible in 2019, he said.
</P>
<P>
City council will vote on whether or not to provide the funding Thursday.

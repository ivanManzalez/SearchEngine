Expanded solar panel installation program begins in Halifax; 
</P>
<P>
Solar City now offers panels for home heating and electricity generation
</P>

<P>
A program which offers homeowners in Halifax loans to put solar panels on their houses is back — in an expanded form — following a two-year pilot project.
</P>
<P>
Almost 400 solar systems were installed on homes around the city during the pilot project phase, which ended in 2015.
</P>
<P>
Now, Halifax regional councillors have approved the continuation of the Solar City program for another three years, and registration is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
"Having more choice is always a good thing," said Adam Hayter, energy specialist with the city. This program will help Haligonians reduce their costs, he said, and "take a hold of their energy independence."
</P>
<P>
There's also the environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
"There's a real cost to carbon in terms of the impacts to health and our communities, so this is just a way to help avoid those issues that come from increasing our carbon emissions," Hayter said.
</P>
<P>
Costs
</P>
<P>
City councillors have authorized a $13-million budget for loans during the next phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
The city pays the installation costs and property owners pay the full amount back at a low interest rate over 10 years through a Local Improvement Charge on the property.
</P>
<P>
More options this time
</P>
<P>
The original program was limited to solar hot water systems, which heat water for domestic uses such as showers, dishes and laundry.
</P>
<P>
The new program includes solar hot air systems which can be used for home heating, and solar photovoltaic systems which produce electricity that can be sold back to Nova Scotia Power.
</P>
<P>
More local businesses involved
</P>
<P>
In 2013, some business owners complained after the city selected only one company to supply the solar panels for the project. This time, the process is open to any certified solar contractors.
</P>
<P>
This will help build expertise within the local solar industry, Hayter said, and that is "something that can be exported out in terms of the knowledge and the capacity for creating better communities."
</P>
<P>
Not too foggy here
</P>
<P>
Hayter said it's a misconception that Halifax doesn't get enough sun to warrant the installation of solar panels.
</P>
<P>
You don't need direct sun to make the technology work, he said. "Even on a cloudy, overcast, foggy day, you can actually still generate a fair bit of solar energy."
</P>
<P>
Halifax receives more solar energy during the course of a year than Germany, Hayter said, "and they're considered a world leader for adopting solar."
